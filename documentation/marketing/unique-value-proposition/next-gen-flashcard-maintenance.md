# Next-Gen Flashcard Maintenance - Marketing Pitch

## The Problem with AI-Generated Content

**AI creates content chaos.** When AI generates flashcards, it often dumps everything into one massive pile. You end up with 200+ cards in one topic, mixed subtopics you can't untangle, and no clear learning path. AI-generated content without structure becomes a learning nightmare.

## The Repaso Solution

**Rigid Hierarchy Enforcement**: AI-generated content is automatically structured into clear, learnable hierarchies. No more content chaos.

## What Makes This Revolutionary

**Enforced Structure**: AI content is automatically organized into proper hierarchies before it reaches you. No more flashcard piles or mixed subtopics.

**Predictive Organization**: We suggest proper categorization before you even start.

**Smart Knowledge Updates**: Tell AI what to change without digging in thousands of cards manually. It updates related cards automatically while maintaining proper hierarchy.

**Background Maintenance**: AI continuously monitors and suggests improvements to keep your knowledge current and organized.

**Stop fighting AI chaos. Start learning with structure.**
