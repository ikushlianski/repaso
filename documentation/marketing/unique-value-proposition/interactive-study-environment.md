# Interactive Study Environment - Marketing Pitch

## Two Types of Learners. One Powerful System.

**Course Builders**: Skip expensive courses. Build your own using AI knowledge and any materials you have.

**Bit-by-Bit Learners**: Transform everything you read or watch into actionable knowledge. No courses needed.

## Course Builders: Learn for Free

**Skip Expensive Courses**: Generate complete courses on any topic using AI knowledge. No external materials needed.

**Use Your Own Materials**: Upload materials from any source - work documents, free resources, handouts. AI formulates unified topics and identifies key concepts.

**Full Control**: Exclude topics you don't need. Set focus levels for different areas. Learn exactly what matters to you.

## Bit-by-Bit Learners: Learn as You Go

**Transform Any Content**: Add content links and consume summarized points instead of original content. Learn efficiently without reading full articles.

**Process After Consumption**: Consume content normally, then add it to Repaso. Ask questions and generate cards, or generate cards directly.

## The Key Advantage: Actionable Knowledge

**Notes are passive. Flashcards are active.**

You're not just building notes from AI - notes sit there unused. What's actionable is flashcards that you make a habit of learning. Turn yourself into a learning machine with 10 hands instead of two.

## The Problem with AI Courses

**You've probably tried ChatGPT courses and abandoned them.**

You get lost in endless content and topics. No easy way to track what you've completed and what's still ahead. You end up with scattered knowledge and no clear progress.

**Repaso solves this.**

Every piece of content becomes trackable flashcards. You always know exactly what you've learned and what's next. No more getting lost in AI-generated content.

## Why This Changes Everything

Traditional learning forces you to choose between expensive courses or passive note-taking. Repaso gives you both: free, personalized courses AND active learning from any content. Whether you want structured learning or learn-as-you-go, our AI adapts to your style.

**Two approaches. One goal. Become a learning machine.**
