# Unique Value Proposition

## The Core Problem

Developers learn constantly but forget most of what they've learned. Existing solutions suck:

- **Anki**: Code looks terrible on mobile, complex setup
- **Notes apps**: No spaced repetition, information gets buried
- **Video courses**: Passive learning, poor retention
- **Documentation**: Great reference, terrible for memorization

## Our Solution

**"Flashcards for developers that actually work on mobile"**

We turn your code and documentation into structured, reviewable knowledge that fits in your pocket.

## What Makes Us Different

### 1. Code That Looks Good on Phones
Everyone else treats code as an afterthought. We designed the entire system around making code readable and interactive on small screens.

**Others**: Tiny, unreadable code blocks
**Us**: Smart syntax highlighting, zoom controls, copy-paste functionality

### 2. AI That Doesn't Create Chaos  
Most AI tools dump everything in one pile. We enforce proper hierarchies and structure before content reaches you.

**Others**: 200 random flashcards in one deck
**Us**: Organized learning paths with clear progressions

### 3. Workflow Integration That Actually Works
We meet developers where they already work instead of forcing context switches.

**Others**: Separate app you never remember to use
**Us**: Capture from GitHub, VS Code, browser - study anywhere

### 4. Learning System Built for Technical Content
Generic spaced repetition algorithms don't account for how developers learn technical concepts.

**Others**: Same algorithm for vocabulary and code
**Us**: Optimized intervals for syntax vs concepts vs algorithms

## Value Props by User Type

### Individual Developers
**Promise**: "Stop forgetting what you just learned"
**Proof**: Mobile-optimized flashcards with proper code display
**Payoff**: Actually retain knowledge from tutorials and documentation

### Senior Engineers  
**Promise**: "Nail your next technical interview"
**Proof**: Structured review system for algorithms and system design
**Payoff**: Confident performance in high-stakes interviews

### Development Teams
**Promise**: "New team members who actually remember your training"
**Proof**: Shared knowledge bases with proven retention metrics
**Payoff**: Faster onboarding, fewer repeated questions

## Messaging Framework

### Primary Message
"Flashcards for developers that work on mobile"

### Supporting Messages
- "Code that's actually readable on your phone"
- "Import from GitHub, study anywhere"  
- "AI organization that doesn't suck"
- "Spaced repetition for technical concepts"

### Proof Points
- Syntax highlighting for 20+ languages
- GitHub integration for automatic imports  
- Mobile app with offline study capability
- Team dashboards showing retention metrics

### Call to Action
"Try Repaso for free - import your first GitHub repo in under 60 seconds"

## Positioning Against Competitors

**vs Anki**: "Anki for developers - mobile experience that doesn't suck"
**vs Notion**: "Notion with spaced repetition - knowledge that sticks"
**vs LeetCode**: "LeetCode for everything - not just algorithms"
**vs Pluralsight**: "Active learning - retain what you watch"

## Objection Handling

**"I don't have time for flashcards"**
→ "Study during commutes, bathroom breaks, waiting in line - 5 minutes adds up"

**"I can just look things up"**
→ "Looking up wastes time during coding. Having it memorized makes you faster"

**"Free alternatives exist"**  
→ "Your time is worth more than fighting with bad mobile UX"

**"My team won't use it"**
→ "Start individual, prove retention improvements, then expand to team"

## Success Metrics

**Awareness**: Developer mentions Repaso when discussing learning tools
**Consideration**: Downloads app after seeing mobile code demo  
**Trial**: Imports first content within 60 seconds
**Purchase**: Pays after seeing retention improvements
**Advocacy**: Recommends to other developers
