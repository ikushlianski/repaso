### Day -1: Soft Announcement
**LinkedIn Post**:
```
After 18 months of research and development, we're finally ready.

Tomorrow, I'm launching Repaso - spaced repetition designed for professionals.

The problem: We consume endless learning content but retain almost none of it.

The solution: A system that ensures knowledge actually sticks.

For senior developers, data scientists, and technical professionals who are tired of re-learning the same concepts.

Follow along tomorrow for the full announcement.

### Launch Day: Full Announcement
**Main Launch Post**:
```
ðŸš€ TODAY: Launching Repaso - Premium Spaced Repetition for Professionals

The stats are brutal:
â€¢ Professionals forget 75% of training content within 6 months
â€¢ Senior engineers spend 40% of their time re-looking up information
â€¢ Companies waste $400B annually on training that doesn't stick

We built Repaso to solve this.

â†’ Designed for technical knowledge that needs to stick
â†’ Mobile-optimized for learning during commutes  
â†’ AI-powered content organization
â†’ Built for professionals who value their time

This isn't another learning platform.
It's a retention system.

First 100 users get founding member pricing.
