# Roadmap Strategy Questions

Need your input on these strategic decisions before finalizing the development priorities:

## Go-to-Market Strategy

**Q1: When do we want to start charging users?**
- Option A: Launch with paid plans from day one
- Option B: Free-first strategy, then add paid features later
- Option C: Freemium model with paid upgrades available at launch

I would inclined towards maybe a freemium model free but premium which means that very basic functionality should be free but it also should be pretty limited because people should soon understand that it's pretty expensive to run AI.

If you could explain to me here, what exactly freemuim would be, i'd be glad.

**Q2: How will people discover Repaso?**
- Primary channels: Organic search, paid ads, word-of-mouth, content marketing?
- This affects when we need the marketing website and SEO content

I think we need organics obviously but also content marketing definitely I think also word-of-mouth because people in this area this is a very specific group of people who do flashcards so basically it's the Ankele card audience that would try the product.

**Q3: What's our minimum viable product for public launch?**
- Core flashcards only? Core flashcards definitely
- Must include spaced repetition algorithms? I think we should include a couple of basic algorithms but nothing too specific. And I think those algorithms shouldn't sound scientific instead they should just be natural.
- Mobile app required or web-first? Well, I think we need mobile app honestly, it should be very simple but we do need that.

I would say core flashcards with ability to do some AI generation for cards.

## Marketing & Monetization Timing

**Q4: Should we launch with pricing infrastructure from day one?**
- If yes: Payment infrastructure (Stripe) needs to be Phase 1-2
- If no: Can delay payments until later phases. I think we should add a payment of restructure once payment infrastructure should be in place once we achieve some level of product development where we can charge for it..

**Q5: Do we need the marketing website before beta/public launch?**
- If any public marketing: Website needs to come before AI features yeah I mean I think we need the website first even before content marketing because content marketing needs to be based on this already
- If private beta first: Can delay website yeah I mean that's interesting. Also, cause I think we could do before we we invest our reference into deeply. I would like people to be on the waitlist and just see how many people are on the waitlist that would be very important.

**Q6: What's more important for early growth?**
- Advanced features (AI, analytics) to impress power users? Yeah, I think this one.
- Marketing infrastructure to acquire users at scale?

## Product Strategy

**Q7: Are we building for power users first, or mass market?**
- Power users: Advanced features matter more
- Mass market: Simplicity and marketing matter more
I don't fully understand what the power user is in that context. Yeah, but I would definitely target some narrow audience first.

**Q8: Mobile vs web priority for initial launch?**
- Web-first then mobile?
- Mobile-first?
- Both simultaneously?
Well, I think we should do both mobile and we honestly.

**Q9: Feature-rich vs simple at launch?**
- Rich: More development time, potentially better retention
- Simple: Faster to market, easier to iterate
I would say that it's of course should be simple first but it should target specific people, namely people who use and keyboard there may be lacking API abilities, and they're also lacking AI features. It should probably look and feel like anki

Please answer these questions so I can reorganize the roadmap priorities accordingly.

tasks for you from me:
- Let's add some feature evaluation discussion document so basically what I wanna do is I wanna triage what things we could do relatively fast and also do them in a good way so that people will already be able to pay for them maybe like five dollars a month or maybe three dollars a month if it's a yearly subscription, but I need to know what features exactly we would include what features are really valuable for the user that's what I don't understand so let's have a discussion on this. If you could organize a discussion folder, where you would initiate those discussions that would be great. I don't like discussions in the terminal.
- So I would like a couple of discussion threads here in the IDE, where we would be fleshing out stuff together with you, and then the result of our discussions will be changes to priorities
