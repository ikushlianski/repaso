# Discussion: Feature Value Assessment

## Goal: Identify High-Value, Fast-to-Build Features

We need to determine which features provide enough value for users to pay $3-5/month while being realistic to build quickly.

## Feature Categories by Development Speed

### Quick Wins (2-4 weeks)
- **AI Card Generation**: Use GPT API to create cards from text/topics
- **Rich Text Formatting**: Bold, italic, lists, links in cards
- **Export/Import**: Anki-compatible formats
- **Multiple Card Types**: Basic Q&A, cloze deletion
- **Simple Spaced Repetition**: Basic algorithm, not scientific

### Medium Effort (1-2 months) 
- **Mobile App**: React Native or PWA
- **Advanced Study Modes**: Different review algorithms
- **Deck Sharing**: Share collections with others
- **Progress Analytics**: Study streaks, success rates
- **Sync Across Devices**: Cloud storage

### Heavy Lift (3+ months)
- **Voice Recognition**: For pronunciation practice
- **Advanced AI**: Context-aware generation, updates
- **Team Collaboration**: Multi-user deck editing
- **Marketplace**: Buy/sell card collections

## Value Assessment Questions

**For Anki Users, Which Features Are Most Painful to Live Without?**
1. Mobile app that syncs?
2. Better formatting options?
3. AI to generate cards quickly?
4. Easier sharing/collaboration?
5. Better study analytics?

**What Would Make Someone Switch From Free Anki?**
- Anki is free but complex/ugly
- Anki lacks AI features
- Anki mobile sync is clunky
- Anki has steep learning curve

**Minimum Viable Paid Product:**
If we could only build 3 features beyond basic flashcards, which would generate the most revenue?

Please share your thoughts on:
1. Which features Anki users would pay for most
2. Your experience with Anki's pain points
3. What $3-5/month value proposition makes sense
