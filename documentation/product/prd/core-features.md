# Core Features for Developers

## Code on Mobile That Doesn't Suck
**Problem**: Existing flashcard apps make code unreadable on phones
**Solution**: Smart syntax highlighting that adapts to screen size

- Support top 20 languages (JS, Python, Go, Rust, etc.)
- Auto-detect language from code blocks
- Copy code with one tap
- Light/dark syntax themes
- Zoom and scroll through long functions

## Mobile-First Study Experience
**Problem**: Studying during commutes with terrible mobile UX
**Solution**: Touch-optimized interface designed for one-handed use

- Swipe left/right for next card
- Tap to reveal answers
- Works offline (downloaded decks)
- Fast loading (< 2s per card)
- Study queue available immediately

## Smart Content Import
**Problem**: Manual card creation takes forever
**Solution**: AI turns your docs into structured flashcards

- Upload code files → get flashcard sets
- Import from GitHub repos and wikis
- Browser extension for quick captures
- AI extracts key concepts from documentation
- Hierarchical organization (no 200-card dumps)

## Developer Workflow Integration
**Problem**: Context switching kills productivity
**Solution**: Capture learning moments without leaving your tools

- Browser extension (Chrome/Firefox)
- VS Code extension (highlight code → create card)
- GitHub integration (import READMEs, docs)
- CLI for bulk imports
- Webhook support for automated updates

## Proper Knowledge Organization
**Problem**: Content chaos with poor categorization
**Solution**: Hierarchical structure that makes sense

- Nested folders (JavaScript → React → Hooks)
- Smart tagging (auto-tag by language, difficulty)
- Drag-and-drop organization
- Search within categories
- Bulk operations (tag, move, delete multiple cards)

## Spaced Repetition That Works
**Problem**: Generic algorithms don't work for technical content
**Solution**: Algorithm tuned for code and concept retention

- SM-2 algorithm with technical content adjustments
- Difficulty rating per card (Easy/Good/Hard/Again)
- Daily study queue with optimal scheduling
- Progress tracking and retention statistics
- Adaptive intervals based on content type

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (MVP)**:
1. Mobile code display
2. Basic flashcard experience
3. Manual card creation
4. Simple organization

**Phase 2 (Growth)**:
5. AI content import
6. GitHub integration
7. Browser extension
8. Advanced organization

**Phase 3 (Scale)**:
9. VS Code extension
10. Team collaboration
11. Interactive code execution
12. Public deck marketplace

## Success Metrics

**Usage**: Daily active users > 15 min, mobile usage > 70%
**Content**: Cards created per user per week, deck completion rates
**Retention**: Spaced repetition adherence, knowledge retention scores
