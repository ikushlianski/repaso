# Repaso Product Strategy

We're building premium spaced repetition for professionals. Think Duolingo, but for technical knowledge that actually matters for your career.

## The Plan

Start with individual technical professionals (developers, data scientists, engineers) who need to retain complex information for career advancement. Prove retention works. Expand to teams, then enterprise learning.

**Market**: Professional knowledge management meets spaced repetition
**Competition**: We compete with Anki (too generic), Pluralsight (passive learning), Notion (no retention), and language learning apps (not professional)

## Who We're Building For

**Primary**: Technical professionals who need to retain complex information
- Developers learning frameworks and preparing for interviews
- Data scientists memorizing ML concepts and algorithms  
- Engineers studying system design and architecture patterns
- Bootcamp grads reinforcing fundamentals

**Secondary**: Technical teams and learning organizations

**What they want**: Professional-grade learning tools, mobile accessibility, proven retention results

## Why Repaso

Professionals consume learning content constantly but retain almost none of it. Existing tools are either too generic (Anki) or don't focus on retention (everything else).

**What makes us different:**
- Premium design that professionals actually want to use
- Technical content that displays properly on mobile
- AI organization that creates proper learning hierarchies
- Integration with professional workflows (GitHub, documentation)
- Spaced repetition optimized for complex technical concepts

## Where We're Going

**Year 1**: Best flashcards for developers
**Year 2**: Knowledge management platform teams actually use
**Long-term**: Full learning management system with Repaso as the retention engine

## How We'll Grow

**Start**: Build in public, solve real problems, get individual developers hooked
**Scale**: Happy users bring their teams, add collaboration features
**Expand**: Corporate training when we have proven retention metrics

## Success Metrics

**Year 1 Goals:**
- 500 active individual users
- 20 paying subscribers
- Product-market fit validation

**Key Performance Indicators:**
- Daily active users
- Knowledge retention rates
- User-generated content volume
- Net Promoter Score
- Monthly recurring revenue

## What Could Go Wrong

Developers might not pay for flashcards. Big players might copy us. Technical complexity might kill us.

**Our hedge**: Start with people who already understand the value (experienced devs), focus on features nobody else has (mobile code display), and validate everything with real users before building.
