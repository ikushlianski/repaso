# Product: User Experience Decisions

## Onboarding Flow

### Q1: First user experience?
Critical for conversion. What happens after signup?

**Options:**
- [ ] Immediate "paste your content" screen
- [ ] Pre-made demo deck to try first
- [ ] Guided tutorial with sample generation
- [ ] Video walkthrough then free explore
- [ ] Generate cards from their GitHub profile

**My recommendation:** Pre-made demo deck (30 seconds to value) → then "paste your content"

### Q2: Generation UX?
How does AI generation feel?

**Flow options:**
- [ ] Paste → Instant cards (process in background)
- [ ] Paste → Loading → Show all cards at once
- [ ] Paste → Stream cards as they generate
- [ ] Paste → Preview → Confirm → Generate

**My recommendation:** Stream cards as they generate - feels magical, keeps engagement

## Mobile Experience

### Q3: Mobile priority?
Given mobile is our differentiator:

**Launch approach:**
- [ ] Desktop only first (faster)
- [ ] Mobile web responsive (must have)
- [ ] PWA from day 1
- [ ] Native app immediately

**My recommendation:** Mobile web responsive is non-negotiable, PWA can wait

Our key differentiator:

**Features needed:**
- [ ] Horizontal scroll for long lines
- [ ] Syntax highlighting
- [ ] Zoom/pinch support
- [ ] Light/dark theme
- [ ] Copy button

**My recommendation:** All except themes (add later)

## Review Experience

### Q5: Study session UX?
How do users review cards?

**Options:**
- [ ] Classic: Show question → reveal answer → rate difficulty
- [ ] Interactive: Type/code the answer
- [ ] AI-assisted: Get hints if stuck
- [ ] Mixed: Depends on card type

**My recommendation:** Classic for MVP, but with good mobile gestures (swipe)

### Q6: Progress visualization?
How to show learning progress?

**Options:**
- [ ] Simple: X cards due today
- [ ] Streaks: Daily study streak
- [ ] Charts: Retention graphs
- [ ] Gamified: XP and levels

**My recommendation:** Simple + Streaks (motivating but not complex)
