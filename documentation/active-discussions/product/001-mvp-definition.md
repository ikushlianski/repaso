# Product: MVP Definition (AI-First Approach)

## Core Value Proposition

### Q1: Primary value statement?
Given AI is table stakes, what's our hook?

**Options:**
- [ ] "Turn any documentation into flashcards in seconds"
- [ ] "AI tutor that knows what you need to review"
- [ ] "Learn programming 10x faster with AI-generated cards"
- [ ] "Your code snippets become interactive flashcards"

**My recommendation:** First option - clear, specific, solves real pain point

*Your answer:*

### Q2: Target user for first 1000?
Be extremely specific:

**Options:**
- [ ] Bootcamp students learning first framework
- [ ] Mid-level devs learning cloud (AWS/Azure)

### Q4: AI generation limits?
For free tier:

**Options:**
- [ ] 5 generations total (harsh, forces quick decision)
- [ ] 10 generations/month (renewable)
- [ ] 50 cards total (generation unlimited until cap)
- [ ] 3 free documents, then pay

**My recommendation:** 3 free documents - easy to understand, natural upgrade point

### Q5: Card quality controls?
Users will generate garbage if not guided:

**Minimum controls:**
- [ ] Preset templates (definition, code example, concept)
- [ ] AI suggests improvements
- [ ] User can edit/refine
- [ ] Bulk accept/reject generated cards

**My recommendation:** Just edit/refine + bulk accept/reject. Keep it simple.
