# Critical Path: AI-First MVP

## ‚ö° Minimum Viable Product (3-4 weeks)

Based on market reality: **AI is non-negotiable**. Here's the absolute minimum to test demand:

### Week 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Next.js + Vercel setup
2. Clerk auth integration  
3. PostgreSQL (Neon) + Prisma
4. Basic UI with Tailwind + shadcn/ui

### Week 2: AI Magic
1. OpenAI integration (GPT-4o-mini)
2. URL/text ‚Üí flashcard generation
3. Content caching system
4. Basic card editor

### Week 3: Learning Loop
1. Spaced repetition algorithm
2. Card review interface (mobile-first)
3. Progress tracking
4. Stripe payment integration

### Week 4: Launch Prep
1. Landing page
2. Onboarding flow
3. Error handling
4. Basic analytics (PostHog)

## üéØ Success Metrics

**Week 1 after launch:**
- 200+ signups
- 50+ documents processed
- 10+ paid conversions ($9/month)
- 1000+ cards generated

**If we don't hit these ‚Üí pivot immediately**

## üí∞ Monetization

**Free tier:**
- 3 document imports
- 50 cards total
- Basic features

**Pro tier ($9/month):**
- Unlimited AI generation
- Unlimited cards
- Export features
- Priority support

## üöÄ Launch Strategy

1. **Soft launch** on Reddit (r/learnprogramming)
2. **Gather feedback** for 1 week
3. **Fix critical issues**
4. **Product Hunt launch**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Decisions Needed NOW

1. **Confirm AI-first approach** (not traditional flashcards)
2. **Pick specific target** (bootcamp students vs senior devs)
3. **Set launch date** (recommend: 4 weeks from today)
4. **Decide your involvement** (full-time vs side project)

## üìã Next Actions

1. Answer questions in `active-discussions/` folders
2. I'll create detailed todos in `/todos/` based on answers
3. Start building Week 1 immediately

---

**My strongest recommendation:**

Skip everything except AI generation + basic review. Ship in 3 weeks. 

If 100 people don't want to pay $9 for "paste docs ‚Üí get flashcards", then no amount of features will save this.

**The market will tell you what to build next.**
