# Technical: Implementation Priorities

## Development Speed vs Quality

### Q1: Technical debt tolerance?
For MVP validation:

**Acceptable shortcuts:**
- [ ] No tests initially
- [ ] Minimal error handling
- [ ] Basic UI (no polish)
- [ ] No monitoring/analytics
- [ ] Hardcoded configurations

**My recommendation:** No tests + Basic UI only. Must have error handling and analytics.
