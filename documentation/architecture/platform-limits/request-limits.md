## How We Calculate Costs

### What Affects the Price
We consider several factors when calculating how much each AI request will cost:

- **Model Choice**: Different AI models have different base costs
- **Content Complexity**: Longer, more technical content costs more to process
- **Processing Options**: Additional features like detailed analysis add to the cost
- **Content Type**: Some types of content are more complex to process than others

### How We Analyze Your Content
- **Length**: We look at how much content you're processing
- **Technical Difficulty**: We check for specialized terminology and complex concepts
- **Structure**: We consider how well-organized and formatted your content is
- **Language**: We factor in language complexity and any translation needs

## How We Choose the Right Model

### What We Look At
1. **Content Type**: Is it text, video, audio, or a document?
2. **Task Complexity**: Are you doing simple generation or complex analysis?
3. **Your Preferences**: What's your budget and quality requirements?
4. **Your History**: What models have worked well for you in the past?

### How We Decide
1. **Task Match**: Does the model have the right capabilities for your task?
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Are you getting good quality for the price?
3. **Your Choices**: We respect your override settings and past preferences
4. **Your Limits**: We work within your available request budget

### What You Get
When we recommend a model, we tell you:
- **Which Model**: The specific AI model we recommend
- **Why We Chose It**: Clear explanation of our reasoning
- **Estimated Cost**: How much it will cost before you proceed
- **Confidence Level**: How sure we are this is the right choice
- **Alternatives**: Other options you might consider

## How to Get the Most Value

### Content Preparation
- **Summarize First**: Reduce content length before complex analysis to save costs
- **Break It Down**: Split large content into manageable pieces for better processing
- **Clean It Up**: Remove irrelevant sections before processing to focus on what matters
- **Standardize Format**: Make sure your content is well-formatted for better AI understanding

### Smart Processing
- **Group Similar Tasks**: Process similar content together to reduce overhead
- **Reuse Patterns**: Use similar content structures for more efficient processing
- **Cache Results**: We store and reuse similar processing results to save you money
- **Optimize Timing**: We manage processing order to get you the best results

### Helpful Guidance
