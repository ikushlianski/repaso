# Platform Limits Overview

## Why We Need Boundaries

Every successful platform needs clear boundaries to ensure everyone gets fair access while keeping costs manageable. Think of it like a restaurant - we need to know how many people we can serve well without running out of ingredients or making everyone wait too long.

Our limits aren't about restricting you - they're about creating a sustainable system where everyone can learn effectively without the platform breaking down or becoming too expensive to maintain.

## What We're Protecting

**Fair Access**: Making sure one heavy user doesn't slow down the experience for everyone else. It's like ensuring everyone gets a turn on the playground.

**Quality Experience**: Keeping response times fast and features working smoothly, even during peak usage times.

**Sustainable Growth**: Balancing what we can provide with what it costs to run, so we can keep improving the platform for everyone.

**Resource Management**: Making sure our AI services, storage, and processing power are used efficiently and fairly.

## Our Philosophy

We believe in generous limits that actually let you use the platform meaningfully. Our free tier isn't just a teaser - it's genuinely useful for getting started with learning. When you're ready for more, our premium tiers provide clear value through higher limits and advanced features.

We're constantly watching how people actually use the platform so we can adjust limits based on real needs, not arbitrary restrictions.
