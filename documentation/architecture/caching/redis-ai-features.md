# Redis AI Features Integration

## Running AI Directly in Redis

This is where things get really interesting - we can actually run AI models directly inside Redis using their AI modules. This means we can do TensorFlow, PyTorch, or ONNX model inference without leaving the Redis environment. We can even write custom Lua scripts for specialized AI processing.

## Smart Vector Search

Redis has built-in vector search capabilities that let us find similar content incredibly fast. We use the HNSW algorithm (think of it as a super-efficient way to find similar things) to search through content embeddings. We can store all our content "fingerprints" in Redis and search them in real-time, or even combine text search with vector search for the best of both worlds.

## Real-time AI Processing

We use Redis Streams to queue up AI requests and process them in real-time. The cool part is we can serve AI models directly from Redis, so everything happens in one place. We batch similar requests together for efficiency and cache the results intelligently.

## Why This Approach Works

By keeping AI processing close to our data, we eliminate network latency and make everything faster. We're more memory efficient since models and data share the same memory space. We can scale horizontally across multiple Redis instances, and most importantly, we reduce our external AI API calls by 60-80%, which saves us a ton of money.
