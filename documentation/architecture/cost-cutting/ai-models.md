# AI Model Cost Optimization

## Ultra-Cheap Models for Simple Tasks

**GPT-3.5-turbo**: $0.002/1K tokens - Perfect for basic text processing, simple grouping, and trivial tasks. This handles 80% of our requests at minimal cost.

**Claude Haiku**: $0.00025/1K tokens - Even cheaper than GPT-3.5, great for simple text extraction and basic categorization.

**Gemini Pro**: $0.0005/1K tokens - Google's model, excellent for straightforward text processing and basic analysis.

**Local Models**: Ollama with Llama 3.2 3B - Run on user's device for ultra-cheap processing of simple tasks.

## Frontend AI Pre-Processing

**TinyLlama 1.1B**: Runs in browser, analyzes user input to determine complexity and route to appropriate backend model. Costs virtually nothing.

**DistilBERT**: Lightweight model for text classification, determines if content needs simple processing or complex AI analysis.

**Sentence Transformers**: Runs locally to find similar content and avoid duplicate AI calls.

## Smart Routing Logic

**Simple Tasks** (use cheap models): Basic text extraction, simple categorization, duplicate detection, basic formatting.

**Medium Tasks** (use GPT-3.5): Content summarization, basic card generation, simple document processing.

**Complex Tasks** (use GPT-4): Research-heavy content, complex document analysis, advanced card generation with context.

## Cost-Saving Techniques

**Batch Processing**: Group similar requests to reduce API call overhead.

**Prompt Optimization**: Shorter, more focused prompts reduce token usage by 30-50%.

**Response Caching**: Cache similar responses to avoid repeated AI calls.

**Model Switching**: Start with cheapest model, upgrade only if response quality is insufficient.
