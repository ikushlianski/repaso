# AI Request Routing Strategy

## Frontend Pre-Analysis (Considered but Not Implemented)

**Browser Model Download**: We considered downloading TinyLlama 1.1B (700MB) to run in browser for input analysis, but this is not realistic for mobile devices or users with limited bandwidth.

**Alternative Approach**: Instead, we route all requests to backend immediately and use fast, cheap models there for analysis.

## Backend Routing Strategy

**Immediate Analysis**: When user submits prompt, we immediately call a very cheap, fast model to analyze complexity.

**Self-Hosted Tiny Model**: We self-host a lightweight model (like TinyLlama 1.1B) on our infrastructure for instant analysis.

**Fallback Strategy**: If our tiny model is unavailable, we default to a medium-sized model rather than the cheapest option, since the task might be more complex than we can determine without analysis.

**Smart Defaults**: When we can't analyze the request, we err on the side of using a more capable model to ensure quality.

## Backend Routing Logic

**Immediate Tiny Model Analysis**: Every request first goes to our self-hosted tiny model for instant complexity assessment.

**Simple Tasks** (0.1-1 cent per request):
- Basic text extraction from documents
- Simple categorization and tagging
- Duplicate content detection
- Basic formatting and cleanup

**Medium Tasks** (1-5 cents per request):
- Content summarization
- Basic card generation
- Simple document processing
- Text translation and localization

**Complex Tasks** (5-20 cents per request):
- Research-heavy content analysis
- Complex document understanding
- Advanced card generation with context
- Multi-step reasoning tasks

**Fallback Strategy**: If tiny model analysis fails, we default to medium-sized model to ensure quality rather than risking poor results with the cheapest option.

## Cost Control Measures

**Request Batching**: Group similar requests to reduce API call overhead.

**Response Caching**: Cache responses for 24-48 hours to avoid duplicate processing.

**Model Fallback**: Start with cheapest model, upgrade only if quality is insufficient.

**Rate Limiting**: Limit AI requests per user tier to control costs.

## Quality Assurance

**Response Validation**: Check response quality and retry with better model if needed.

**User Feedback**: Learn from user corrections to improve routing decisions.

**A/B Testing**: Test different model combinations to optimize cost vs. quality.

**Performance Monitoring**: Track costs per user and per request type.
