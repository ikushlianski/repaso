# Backend AI Routing Implementation

## Self-Hosted Tiny Model Strategy

**Model Choice**: TinyLlama 1.1B or similar lightweight model for instant analysis
**Infrastructure**: Self-hosted on our servers for fast, reliable access
**Response Time**: Sub-100ms analysis for routing decisions
**Cost**: Minimal cost since we control the infrastructure
**Availability**: High availability with fallback to cloud models

## Routing Flow

**User Request**: User submits prompt for AI processing
**Immediate Analysis**: Tiny model analyzes complexity in under 100ms
**Route Decision**: Based on analysis, route to appropriate model tier
**Processing**: Execute request with chosen model
**Response**: Return results to user with cost attribution

## Fallback Strategy

**Primary**: Self-hosted tiny model for analysis
**Secondary**: Cloud-based tiny model if self-hosted fails
**Tertiary**: Default to medium model if analysis unavailable
**Quality Focus**: Err on side of better quality rather than lower cost
**User Experience**: Ensure users get good results even when routing fails

## Cost Optimization

**Analysis Efficiency**: Tiny model analysis costs virtually nothing
**Smart Routing**: Route to cheapest appropriate model
**Batch Processing**: Group similar requests when possible
**Caching**: Cache analysis results for similar requests
**Monitoring**: Track routing accuracy and adjust thresholds

## Implementation Benefits

**No Browser Download**: No need to download large models to user devices
**Fast Analysis**: Sub-100ms routing decisions
**Reliable Fallback**: Always have a working solution
**Cost Control**: Route to cheapest appropriate model
**Quality Assurance**: Ensure users get good results
**Scalability**: Easy to scale analysis infrastructure

## Technical Considerations

**Model Serving**: Use efficient model serving infrastructure
**Load Balancing**: Distribute analysis load across multiple instances
**Monitoring**: Track model performance and routing accuracy
**Updates**: Easy model updates and version management
**Scaling**: Scale analysis capacity based on demand
