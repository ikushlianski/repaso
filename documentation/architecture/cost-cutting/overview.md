# Cost-Cutting Strategies Overview

## Smart AI Model Routing

We use a two-tier approach to AI costs. For simple tasks like basic text grouping or trivial processing, we route to ultra-cheap models that cost pennies. For complex tasks requiring research or deep analysis, we use more expensive models. We even run tiny models on the frontend to pre-analyze user input and determine the right backend model to call.

## Infrastructure Optimization

We leverage Cloudflare's generous free tiers and pay-as-you-scale pricing. We use per-user databases that only consume resources when users are active. We implement aggressive caching to reduce compute costs and use CDN for global content delivery.

## Development & Operations

We use managed services to avoid DevOps overhead and focus on building features. We implement feature flags to test with small user groups before full rollouts. We use serverless functions that only run when needed, eliminating idle server costs.

## Data & Storage

We compress everything we can and use intelligent data lifecycle management. We store frequently accessed data in fast storage and archive older data in cheaper storage. We implement data deduplication to avoid storing the same content multiple times.
