# Synchronization Strategy

## How Electric SQL Works

**Local-First**: All operations happen on local data first, then sync to cloud
**Real-time Updates**: Changes sync instantly across all user devices
**Offline Support**: Full functionality without internet connection
**Conflict Resolution**: Smart handling of simultaneous changes
**Progressive Sync**: Only sync changes, not entire datasets

## Sync Triggers

**Immediate Sync**: Critical changes like user settings sync immediately
**Background Sync**: Card updates and study progress sync in background
**Batch Sync**: Group related changes to reduce network overhead
**Manual Sync**: Users can force sync when needed
**Scheduled Sync**: Regular sync during low-activity periods

## Conflict Resolution

**Last-Write-Wins**: Simple conflicts resolved by timestamp
**User Resolution**: Complex conflicts presented to user for decision
**AI Assistance**: AI helps resolve conflicts intelligently
**Merge Strategies**: Automatically merge compatible changes
**Rollback Options**: Users can revert to previous versions

## Data Prioritization

**Critical Data**: User settings and authentication sync first
**Study Data**: Card content and study progress sync next
**Metadata**: Tags, organization, and preferences sync last
**AI Data**: AI requests and responses sync when convenient
**Analytics**: Usage data syncs in background

## Performance Optimization

**Incremental Sync**: Only sync changes since last sync
**Compression**: Compress data for faster transmission
**Batching**: Group multiple changes into single sync operation
**Bandwidth Awareness**: Adapt sync frequency to connection quality
**Storage Management**: Clean up old data to save space

## User Control

**Sync Preferences**: Users control what data syncs and when
**Offline Mode**: Users can disable sync entirely
**Data Export**: Users can export their data anytime
**Privacy Controls**: Users control data sharing and visibility
**Sync Status**: Clear indication of sync status and progress
