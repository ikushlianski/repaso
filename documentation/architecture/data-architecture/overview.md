# Data Architecture Overview

## Our Local-First Approach

We're building a local-first application where every user has their own complete copy of data on their device. This means instant responses, full offline functionality, and no data loss. Electric SQL handles the complex synchronization between devices and our cloud database.

## Why Electric SQL

**Perfect for Our Needs**: Electric SQL is designed exactly for what we're building - syncing data from Postgres into local applications
**Postgres Compatibility**: Works with any Postgres database, including Cloudflare D1
**Partial Replication**: Only sync the data each user actually needs
**Real-time Updates**: Changes sync instantly across all devices
**Offline-First**: Full functionality without internet connection
**Conflict Resolution**: Smart handling of simultaneous changes

## How It Works

**Local Database**: Each device has a complete copy of user data using PGlite (SQLite in the browser)
**Electric Sync**: Electric SQL syncs changes between local database and cloud Postgres
**Conflict Resolution**: Smart algorithms handle conflicts when users make changes on multiple devices
**Progressive Sync**: Only sync changes, not entire datasets
**User Control**: Users can choose what to sync and when

## Benefits for Users

**Instant Response**: Everything happens locally, so it feels instant
**Offline Learning**: Study anywhere, even without internet
**No Data Loss**: Changes are saved locally immediately
**Cross-Device Sync**: Seamless experience across web, mobile, and desktop
**Privacy**: Data stays on user's device by default
**Performance**: Faster than traditional client-server applications
