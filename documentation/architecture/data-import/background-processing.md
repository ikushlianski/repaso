# Background Processing Architecture

System for handling large data imports in the background while maintaining app responsiveness and user experience.

## Architecture Overview

### Queue-Based Processing
- Redis-based job queue for import tasks
- Worker processes for background execution
- Priority-based task scheduling
- Automatic retry and error handling
- Real-time progress tracking

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Upload**: File uploaded to temporary storage
2. **Queue**: Import task added to processing queue
3. **Process**: Background worker handles import
4. **Notify**: User notified of completion
5. **Cleanup**: Temporary files removed

## Technical Implementation

### Job Queue System
```typescript
interface ImportJob {
  id: string
  userId: string
  filePath: string
  format: 'anki' | 'quizlet' | 'csv'
  status: 'queued' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed'
  progress: number
  errors: ImportError[]
  createdAt: Date
  completedAt?: Date
}
```

### Worker Process
- Dedicated worker processes for import tasks
- Horizontal scaling based on queue size
- Resource monitoring and management
- Graceful shutdown and restart
- Error recovery and retry logic

### Progress Tracking
- Real-time progress updates via WebSocket
- Percentage completion calculation
- Current operation status
- Estimated time remaining
- Error reporting and details

## User Experience

### Immediate Feedback
- Upload confirmation and job ID
- Progress bar with real-time updates
- Ability to continue using app
- Notification when import completes
- Access to partially imported content

### Error Handling
- Clear error messages and suggestions
- Ability to retry failed imports
- Partial import recovery
- Support for corrupted files
- Detailed error logging

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Multiple worker processes
- Load balancing across workers
- Queue partitioning by user/priority
- Auto-scaling based on queue depth
- Resource monitoring and alerts

### Performance Optimization
- Streaming processing for large files
- Memory-efficient data structures
- Database connection pooling
- CDN integration for media files
- Caching for repeated operations

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics
- Queue depth and processing rate
- Worker utilization and performance
- Error rates and types
- Import completion times
- User satisfaction scores

### Logging
- Structured logging for all operations
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance monitoring
- User action tracking
- System health monitoring

## Security and Compliance

### Data Protection
- Encrypted temporary storage
- Secure file processing
- User data isolation
- Audit logging
- GDPR compliance

### Resource Management
- Memory limits for workers
- CPU usage monitoring
- Storage quotas and cleanup
- Rate limiting per user
- Resource exhaustion protection
