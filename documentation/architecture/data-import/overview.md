# Data Import Architecture

Comprehensive system for importing flashcard data from competitors and other platforms, enabling seamless user migration and rapid onboarding.

## Overview

The data import system handles migration from various flashcard platforms, with special focus on Anki due to its market dominance. The architecture supports both immediate and background processing, ensuring users can continue using the app while large collections are being transferred.

## Key Components

### Import Pipeline
- File validation and format detection
- Data extraction and parsing
- Content transformation and mapping
- Media file processing and storage
- Database insertion and indexing
- Progress tracking and error handling

### Supported Formats
- **Anki**: .apkg packages (primary focus)
- **Quizlet**: Export formats and API integration
- **SuperMemo**: Legacy format support
- **Generic**: CSV, JSON, and other standard formats
- **Manual**: User-guided import for unsupported formats

### Processing Modes
- **Immediate**: Small collections processed instantly
- **Background**: Large collections queued for processing
- **Streaming**: Real-time processing with progress updates
- **Batch**: Bulk processing for multiple imports

## Architecture Principles

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling for background processing
- Queue-based architecture for large imports
- Efficient memory usage for large files
- Parallel processing where possible

### Reliability
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Data validation at every step
- Rollback capability for failed imports
- Detailed logging and monitoring

### User Experience
- Minimal waiting time for small imports
- Clear progress indication for large imports
- Ability to use app during background processing
- Graceful error handling and user feedback

## Technical Considerations

### Data Transformation
- Mapping between different card formats
- Handling platform-specific features
- Preserving user data and study progress
- Converting scheduling algorithms

### Media Handling
- File format conversion and optimization
- Storage and CDN integration
- Duplicate detection and deduplication
- Bandwidth optimization for large files

### Performance
- Streaming processing for large files
- Memory-efficient parsing
- Database optimization for bulk inserts
- Caching for repeated operations
