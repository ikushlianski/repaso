# Performance Architecture Overview

## Performance Goals

We aim to make Repaso feel instant and responsive, even with complex AI processing happening behind the scenes. Our performance strategy focuses on perceived speed rather than just raw metrics.

## Key Performance Areas

**Response Times**: API responses under 200ms for cached content, under 2 seconds for AI processing
**Sync Performance**: Real-time sync with sub-second updates across devices
**AI Processing**: Smart caching and model selection to minimize wait times
**Frontend Performance**: Instant UI updates with optimistic rendering
**Global Performance**: CDN delivery for fast content access worldwide

## Performance Strategy

**Local-First Architecture**: Users see changes instantly, sync happens in background
**Intelligent Caching**: Cache everything we can to avoid expensive operations
**Progressive Loading**: Load content as needed, not everything at once
**Smart AI Routing**: Use fastest appropriate model for each task
**Edge Computing**: Process requests close to users for minimal latency

## Monitoring and Optimization

**Real User Monitoring**: Track actual user experience, not just server metrics
**Performance Budgets**: Set limits on bundle size, load times, and resource usage
**Continuous Optimization**: Regular performance audits and improvements
**User Feedback**: Monitor user complaints about slow performance
**A/B Testing**: Test performance improvements with real users
