# Sync Performance Strategy

## Sync Speed Targets

**Real-time Updates**: Sub-second updates for active users
**Background Sync**: Complete sync within 30 seconds of changes
**Conflict Resolution**: Resolve conflicts within 5 seconds
**Offline Sync**: Complete sync within 2 minutes when coming back online

## Local-First Architecture

**Instant Updates**: Users see changes immediately in local storage
**Background Sync**: Sync happens transparently in background
**Optimistic UI**: Show changes before server confirmation
**Conflict Prevention**: Smart conflict detection and resolution
**Offline Support**: Full functionality when offline

## Sync Optimization

**Delta Sync**: Only sync changes, not entire datasets
**Compression**: Compress sync data to reduce transfer time
**Batching**: Group multiple changes into single sync operations
**Priority Queuing**: Sync critical changes first
**Smart Scheduling**: Sync during low-activity periods

## Conflict Resolution

**Last-Write-Wins**: Simple conflicts resolved automatically
**User Resolution**: Complex conflicts presented to user for decision
**AI Assistance**: AI helps resolve content conflicts intelligently
**Version History**: Track all changes for conflict resolution
**Rollback Options**: Allow users to revert to previous versions

## Performance Monitoring

**Sync Latency**: Track time from change to sync completion
**Conflict Rate**: Monitor frequency of sync conflicts
**Offline Duration**: Track how long users work offline
**Sync Success Rate**: Ensure reliable sync across all devices
**User Satisfaction**: Monitor user feedback on sync experience
