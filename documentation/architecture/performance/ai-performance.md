# AI Processing Performance

## Response Time Targets

**Cached Responses**: Under 100ms for previously processed content
**Simple AI Tasks**: Under 2 seconds for basic text processing
**Complex AI Tasks**: Under 10 seconds for advanced document analysis
**Batch Processing**: Under 30 seconds for multiple document processing

## Model Selection Strategy

**Ultra-Fast Models**: TinyLlama for simple tasks (under 500ms)
**Fast Models**: GPT-3.5-turbo for standard tasks (1-3 seconds)
**Quality Models**: GPT-4 for complex tasks (3-10 seconds)
**Specialized Models**: Custom models for domain-specific tasks (5-15 seconds)

## Caching for Performance

**Similar Content**: 85%+ similarity gets cached response in under 100ms
**Exact Matches**: Instant response from cache
**Partial Matches**: Enhanced prompt with cached context for faster processing
**Model Caching**: Keep frequently used models warm for faster startup

## Optimization Techniques

**Request Batching**: Group similar requests to reduce overhead
**Streaming Responses**: Stream AI responses as they're generated
**Progressive Enhancement**: Show partial results while processing continues
**Background Processing**: Process non-critical tasks in background
**Smart Queuing**: Prioritize urgent requests over batch processing

## User Experience

**Loading States**: Clear feedback during AI processing
**Progress Indicators**: Show estimated time remaining
**Cancel Options**: Allow users to cancel long-running processes
**Result Preview**: Show partial results as they become available
**Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when AI processing fails
