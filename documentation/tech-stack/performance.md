# Performance

We've optimized Repaso for instant performance across all platforms. Everything should feel fast and responsive, no matter how you're using it.

## Frontend Performance

We've optimized the frontend for instant user experience across all platforms.

### How We Make It Fast

- **Code Splitting**: Only load what you need, when you need it
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js automatically optimizes images for speed
- **Service Worker**: Caches content so you can work offline
- **Small Bundles**: Initial load is under 500KB for fast startup

### How We Measure Performance

- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: How quickly you see content
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: How quickly the main content loads
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: How stable the layout is
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: How quickly you can interact with the app

## Backend Performance

Our APIs are designed for fast response times and scalability.

### Performance Features

- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connections for faster queries
- **Query Optimization**: Smart indexing and query optimization
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed data is cached for speed
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: We track performance in real-time

### Database Optimization

- **Smart Indexing**: Proper indexes for fast queries
- **Query Monitoring**: We watch query performance and optimize as needed
- **Connection Management**: Efficient connection pooling
- **Read Replicas**: Use read replicas when we need to scale

## Sync Performance

Electric SQL provides efficient synchronization without slowing you down.

### How Sync Works

- **Incremental Sync**: Only sends data that has changed
- **Background Processing**: Syncs without blocking your interactions
- **Compression**: Efficient data transfer to save bandwidth
- **Smart Batching**: Groups changes together for efficiency

### Performance Monitoring

- **Sync Latency**: We track how quickly data syncs
- **Data Transfer**: Optimize how much data we send
- **Conflict Resolution**: Make sure conflicts are resolved quickly
- **User Impact**: Ensure sync doesn't slow down your experience

## Caching Strategy

### Client-Side Caching

- **Service Worker**: Caches content for offline access
- **Local Storage**: Optimized local data storage
- **Cache Invalidation**: Smart cache management
- **Offline-First**: Always work with local data first

### Server-Side Caching

- **API Response Caching**: Cache API responses for speed
- **Database Query Caching**: Cache database queries
- **Static Asset Caching**: Cache images, CSS, and JavaScript
- **CDN Integration**: Use CDN for global content delivery

## Performance Monitoring

### Real-Time Monitoring

- **Application Metrics**: Track how the app is performing
- **User Experience**: Monitor how users experience the app
- **Error Rates**: Track and fix errors quickly
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor memory, CPU, and network usage

### Performance Optimization

- **Regular Audits**: We regularly check performance and optimize
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Find and fix performance issues
- **Optimization Implementation**: Implement improvements quickly
- **Regression Testing**: Make sure changes don't hurt performance

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

- **Load Balancing**: Distribute load across multiple servers
- **Database Scaling**: Scale databases as we grow
- **CDN Optimization**: Use CDN for global content delivery
- **Microservices**: Move to microservices when needed

### Resource Optimization

- **Memory Usage**: Optimize memory usage for efficiency
- **CPU Utilization**: Monitor and optimize CPU usage
- **Network Bandwidth**: Efficient network usage
- **Storage Efficiency**: Optimize how we store data

## Platform-Specific Performance

### Web Performance

- **Bundle Size**: Keep JavaScript bundles small
- **Image Optimization**: Optimize images for web
- **JavaScript Execution**: Optimize JavaScript performance
- **Network Requests**: Minimize and optimize network requests

### Mobile Performance

- **Native Performance**: Optimize for mobile devices
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage on mobile
- **Battery Usage**: Optimize for battery life
- **Network Efficiency**: Minimize data usage

### Desktop Performance

- **Electron Optimization**: Optimize Electron for desktop
- **System Resources**: Efficient use of system resources
- **File System**: Fast file system operations
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent performance across platforms
