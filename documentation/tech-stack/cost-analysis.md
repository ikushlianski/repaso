# Cost Analysis

We've done realistic cost projections based on actual service pricing, with smart optimization strategies for sustainable growth.

## Monthly Estimates (Early Stage)

Realistic cost projections based on actual service pricing.

### Core Services

- **Neon Postgres**: $0 (free tier)
- **Vercel Hosting**: $0 (hobby plan)
- **Electric SQL**: $0 (development)
- **Auth0**: $0 (free tier)
- **Total: ~$0/month for development**

## Scaling Costs

Cost projections as user base grows, including AI usage.

### Growth scenarios

- 1,000 users: ~$100/month (includes AI costs)
- 10,000 users: ~$400/month (includes AI costs)
- 100,000 users: ~$2,000/month (includes AI costs)

### Cost breakdown

- Database usage and storage: 30%
- API request volume: 20%
- File storage and bandwidth: 10%
- AI model usage: 40%

## AI Cost Optimization

### Model selection strategy

- OpenRouter for cost-effective model access
- Model selection based on task complexity
- Background job batching to reduce API calls
- Local models for privacy-sensitive tasks

### Usage optimization

- Request batching and queuing
- Response caching where appropriate
- User-based usage limits
- Cost monitoring and alerts

## Infrastructure Costs

### Database costs

- Neon Postgres scaling with usage
- Storage costs for user data
- Backup and recovery costs
- Read replica costs for scaling

### Hosting costs

- Vercel hosting scaling
- CDN costs for global distribution
- Edge function execution costs
- Bandwidth and transfer costs

### AI service costs

- Model usage based on complexity
- Background job processing costs
- API request costs
- Data processing costs

## Cost Monitoring

### Real-time tracking

- Per-user cost tracking
- Feature-based cost analysis
- Usage pattern monitoring
- Cost optimization recommendations

### Budget management

- Monthly spending limits
- Cost alerts and notifications
- Usage forecasting
- Optimization recommendations

## Optimization Strategies

### Development phase

- Use free tiers for development
- Optimize for cost during testing
- Monitor usage patterns early
- Plan for scaling costs

### Production phase

- Implement usage-based pricing
- Optimize AI model selection
- Use caching to reduce API calls
- Monitor and optimize continuously

## Revenue Considerations

### Pricing strategy

- Freemium model with usage limits
- Premium tiers for advanced features
- Usage-based pricing for AI features
- Enterprise pricing for large users

### Cost recovery

- AI costs covered by premium users
- Storage costs included in subscriptions
- Bandwidth costs factored into pricing
- Development costs amortized over user base
