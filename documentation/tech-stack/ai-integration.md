# AI Integration

We use the Mastra framework to make AI features accessible and affordable. It gives us a unified interface to multiple AI models while handling all the complex stuff like cost optimization, background processing, and automatic failover.

## Mastra Framework

### What It Does

- **Unified Access**: One interface to access multiple AI models
- **Background Processing**: Handle AI tasks without slowing down the app
- **Cost Optimization**: Automatically choose the most cost-effective model for each task
- **Smart Failover**: If one AI provider has issues, automatically switch to another
- **Rate Limiting**: Manage AI usage to keep costs under control

### Background Processing

- **Card Generation**: Turn documents into flashcards automatically
- **Content Analysis**: Analyze large amounts of content in the background
- **Study Analytics**: Track your learning progress and patterns
- **Content Organization**: Automatically categorize and tag your content
- **Quality Checks**: Make sure generated content meets our standards

## AI Providers and SDKs

### OpenRouter Integration

OpenRouter gives us access to multiple AI models through one API, making it much more cost-effective than going directly to each provider.

#### How We Use It

- **Next.js Integration**: Works seamlessly with our web app
- **OpenAI Compatibility**: Can use OpenAI models when needed
- **Smart Routing**: Automatically picks the right model for each task
- **Cost Optimization**: Chooses the most cost-effective option

#### Models We Support

- **GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo**: Great for complex reasoning and general tasks
- **Claude 3 Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku**: Excellent for analysis and creative tasks
- **Llama 3.1**: Open-source models for privacy-sensitive tasks
- **Specialized Models**: Domain-specific models for specific use cases

### OpenAI SDK

We also integrate directly with OpenAI's official SDK for tasks that need specific features or when reliability is more important than cost.

#### When We Use It

- **Complex Reasoning**: Tasks that need GPT-4's advanced capabilities
- **Specialized Models**: Fine-tuned models for specific domains
- **Advanced Features**: Function calling and other advanced capabilities
- **Critical Tasks**: When reliability is more important than cost

### How We Choose Models

- **Simple Tasks**: GPT-3.5-turbo or Claude Haiku (fast and cheap)
- **Complex Reasoning**: GPT-4 or Claude Opus (powerful but more expensive)
- **Cost-Sensitive**: OpenRouter alternatives (good balance of cost and quality)
- **Privacy-Sensitive**: Local models like Llama 3.1 (your data stays on your device)

## How We Use AI

### Card Generation

- **Text to Flashcards**: Turn any text into study flashcards
- **Question Generation**: Create questions from your study materials
- **Answer Optimization**: Improve and explain answers
- **Difficulty Assessment**: Automatically set difficulty levels

### Content Analysis

- **Document Summarization**: Create summaries of long documents
- **Key Concept Extraction**: Identify the most important concepts
- **Topic Categorization**: Organize content by topic automatically
- **Learning Objectives**: Identify what you should learn from content

### Study Optimization

- **Spaced Repetition**: Improve our study algorithms based on your performance
- **Difficulty Curves**: Analyze how difficult content is for you
- **Learning Patterns**: Understand how you learn best
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggest what to study next

### Background Processing

- **Bulk Content**: Process large amounts of content without slowing you down
- **Quality Assurance**: Automatically check generated content for quality
- **Progress Analytics**: Track your learning progress and patterns
- **Content Recommendations**: Suggest new content based on what you're studying

## Keeping Costs Under Control

### Smart Model Selection

- **Use Cheaper Models**: For simple tasks that don't need advanced AI
- **Reserve Expensive Models**: Only use powerful models when necessary
- **Fallback Strategies**: If one model fails, try a cheaper alternative
- **Usage Monitoring**: Track patterns to optimize costs

### Efficient Processing

- **Batch Requests**: Group similar requests together to reduce costs
- **Background Jobs**: Handle non-urgent tasks in the background
- **Request Queuing**: Smooth out usage to avoid spikes
- **Response Caching**: Reuse similar responses to save money

### Usage Monitoring

- **Per-User Tracking**: See how much each user is spending on AI
- **Feature Analysis**: Understand which features use the most AI
- **Spending Limits**: Set alerts when costs get too high
- **ROI Tracking**: Measure how effective AI features are for learning
