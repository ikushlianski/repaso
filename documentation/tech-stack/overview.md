# Technology Stack Overview

Repaso is built on a local-first architecture that makes everything feel instant. Your data lives on your device first, then syncs seamlessly across all your devices in the background. Think of it like having your own personal copy of everything that's always up to date, no matter where you are.

## Our Core Philosophy

We believe technology should get out of your way. Every interaction should feel instant, like the app is reading your mind. That's why we built everything around local-first architecture - your data lives on your device, so there are no loading screens or waiting around.

## What Makes Us Different

**Instant Everything**: Your data lives on your device first, so everything happens instantly. No more waiting for the internet to catch up.

**One Codebase, Everywhere**: We use Next.js as our foundation, so the same code powers our web app, mobile app, and desktop app. This means you get the same great experience no matter how you access Repaso.

**Smart AI Integration**: We use the Mastra framework to make AI features accessible and affordable. It automatically picks the right AI model for each task and keeps costs down.

**Built for Developers**: Everything is written in TypeScript with strict typing, so we catch problems before they reach you and can build new features faster.

## How We Reach You

We support three ways to use Repaso, all from the same codebase:
- **Web App**: Works in any browser, no installation needed
- **Mobile App**: Native performance on your phone or tablet
- **Desktop App**: Full desktop experience with file system access

Each platform gives you the same core features while taking advantage of what makes that platform special.

## Growing With You

Our architecture grows with you, from your first day using Repaso to when you're managing thousands of flashcards. We handle all the complex sync logic, database scaling, and deployment automatically, so you never have to worry about technical details.

## Built for the Future

We chose technologies that will serve you well for years to come. The local-first approach means Repaso stays fast no matter how many users we have, and our modular AI integration lets us easily add new capabilities as AI technology improves.
