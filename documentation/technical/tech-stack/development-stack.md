# Development Stack

Our development stack is built around making developers productive and happy. We prioritize type safety, maintainability, and rapid iteration across all platforms.

## Language: TypeScript

We use strict TypeScript throughout the entire stack to catch errors early and make development more enjoyable.

### Our Configuration

- **Strict Mode**: Maximum type safety to catch problems before they reach users
- **Shared Types**: Same types between frontend and backend for consistency
- **No `any` Types**: We avoid the `any` type in production code to maintain safety
- **Automated Checking**: Comprehensive type coverage with automated checking

### Why This Matters

- **Catch Errors Early**: Find problems at compile time, not runtime
- **Better IDE Support**: Get helpful autocomplete and error detection
- **Easier Refactoring**: Change code confidently knowing types will catch issues
- **Self-Documenting**: Types serve as documentation for how code should work

## Package Management

We use npm for package management with automated security scanning and dependency updates to keep everything secure and up-to-date.

### Security First

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automatically check for security issues
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies current with the latest fixes
- **License Compliance**: Make sure we're using packages correctly
- **Supply Chain Security**: Monitor the entire dependency chain

### Development Workflow

- **Lock File Management**: Ensure consistent installs across environments
- **Dependency Resolution**: Handle complex dependency relationships
- **Script Automation**: Automate common development tasks
- **Workspace Management**: Organize code in a monorepo structure

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions handles all our automated testing, building, and deployment across all platforms.

### Deployment Strategy

- **Web**: Automatic deployment to Vercel
- **Mobile**: EAS Build for app stores
- **Desktop**: Electron Builder for distribution

### Our Pipeline

1. **Code Quality**: Check for linting and formatting issues
2. **Type Checking**: Ensure all TypeScript compiles correctly
3. **Testing**: Run unit and integration tests
4. **Building**: Create artifacts for all platforms
5. **Deployment**: Deploy to staging or production
6. **Verification**: Make sure everything works after deployment

## Local Development

We've streamlined the development environment to maximize productivity and minimize friction.

### Development Setup

- **Node.js 18+**: Modern JavaScript runtime with TypeScript
- **Local Postgres**: Database for development and testing
- **Hot Reload**: See changes instantly across all platforms

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- **Jest**: Our test framework for running tests
- **React Testing Library**: Test React components like users interact with them
- **Mock Services**: Test components without external dependencies
- **High Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive test coverage

### Integration Testing

- **API Testing**: Test endpoints work correctly
- **Database Tests**: Ensure data operations work as expected
- **Cross-Platform**: Test that features work on all platforms
- **Performance**: Catch performance regressions early

### End-to-End Testing

- **Playwright**: Test the web app like a real user
- **Detox**: Test mobile apps with real device interactions
- **Desktop Testing**: Custom scripts for desktop app testing
- **Automated Execution**: Run all tests automatically in CI

## Code Quality

### Linting and Formatting

- **ESLint**: Catch code quality issues automatically
- **Prettier**: Keep code formatting consistent
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run checks before code is committed
- **Auto-formatting**: Format code automatically on save

### Code Review Process

- **Required Reviews**: All changes must be reviewed by another developer
- **Automated Checks**: Run quality checks before merging
- **Clear Guidelines**: Know what to look for in reviews
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Learn from each other through reviews

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Development Tools

- **React DevTools**: Debug React components easily
- **Redux DevTools**: Understand state management
- **Network Monitoring**: See API calls and responses
- **Performance Profiling**: Find and fix performance issues

### Production Monitoring
