# Infrastructure Cost Optimization

## Cloudflare Free Tier Strategy

**D1 Database**: 5GB free, then $0.75/GB. Per-user databases scale to zero when inactive.

**R2 Storage**: 10GB free, then $0.015/GB. Perfect for document and image storage.

**Redis**: 256MB free tier for caching, scales with usage.

**CDN**: Free global content delivery with automatic optimization.

**Workers**: 100,000 requests/day free, then $0.50/million requests.

## Serverless Architecture

**SST Framework**: Deploy to Cloudflare with zero server management overhead.

**Edge Computing**: Process requests at edge locations closest to users.

**Auto-scaling**: Functions scale to zero when not in use, eliminating idle costs.

**Cold Start Optimization**: Keep functions warm for frequently used endpoints.

## Database Optimization

**Per-User Databases**: Only pay for active users, databases scale to zero when inactive.

**Data Compression**: Compress stored data to reduce storage costs by 60-80%.

**Lifecycle Management**: Move old data to cheaper storage tiers automatically.

**Query Optimization**: Efficient queries reduce compute costs and improve performance.

## Caching Strategy

**Multi-Layer Caching**: Browser → Redis → CDN reduces backend load by 90%.

**Intelligent Cache**: Cache similar content to avoid duplicate processing.

**Cache Warming**: Pre-load popular content during off-peak hours.

**Cache Compression**: Compress cached data to reduce memory usage and costs.
