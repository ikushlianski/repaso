# User Analytics Architecture

Privacy-first analytics system that helps us understand how people learn while respecting their data and learning privacy.

## Overview

We're not building a surveillance system. We're creating a feedback loop that helps us make Repaso better for learning. Every piece of data we collect should directly contribute to improving the learning experience, not just increasing engagement metrics.

The architecture balances detailed insights with user privacy, focusing on aggregate patterns rather than individual tracking. We want to understand what helps people learn effectively, not what keeps them scrolling.

## Core Principles

### Privacy by Design
- Collect only data that directly improves learning outcomes
- Anonymize personal information at the point of collection
- Give users granular control over what gets tracked
- Implement data minimization and purpose limitation
- Regular privacy audits and compliance reviews

### Learning-Focused Metrics
- Track retention and knowledge building, not just time spent
- Measure learning effectiveness, not engagement for its own sake
- Focus on features that improve actual learning outcomes
- Avoid metrics that could lead to manipulative design
- Prioritize user success over platform metrics

### Transparent and Ethical
- Clear communication about what we track and why
- Easy data export and deletion for users
- No hidden tracking or dark patterns
- Regular ethics reviews of analytics practices
- Compliance with privacy regulations worldwide
