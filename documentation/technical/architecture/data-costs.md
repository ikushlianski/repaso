# Data Storage Cost Optimization

## Intelligent Data Lifecycle

**Hot Data**: Frequently accessed content in fast D1 databases.

**Warm Data**: Less frequently accessed content in compressed R2 storage.

**Cold Data**: Archived data in cheapest storage tier with automatic retrieval.

**Data Deduplication**: Avoid storing identical content multiple times across users.

## Compression & Optimization

**Text Compression**: Gzip compression reduces storage by 70-80% for text content.

**Image Optimization**: Automatic image compression and format conversion.

**Document Processing**: Extract only necessary content, discard formatting overhead.

**Vector Compression**: Compress embeddings and vectors for similarity search.

## Storage Tiers

**D1 Database**: Active user data, real-time sync, fast access.

**R2 Storage**: Documents, images, and file uploads with CDN delivery.

**Archive Storage**: Old user data and backups in cheapest available storage.

**Cache Storage**: Temporary data in Redis with automatic expiration.

## Data Management

**Per-User Isolation**: Each user's data in separate database for individual scaling.

**Automatic Cleanup**: Remove unused data and expired cache entries automatically.

**Backup Strategy**: Incremental backups to reduce storage costs.

**Data Retention**: Automatic deletion of old data based on user tier and usage patterns.
