# AI Response Caching

## Finding Similar Content

Here's where it gets clever - we use AI embeddings to understand what content is similar, not just identical. When someone uploads a document about React hooks, we can recognize it's similar to other React content we've processed before. We store these "content fingerprints" in Redis and use them to find matches that are 85% or more similar.

## Our Smart Cache Strategy

**Perfect Match**: If we've seen this exact content before, we return the cached response instantly. No AI call needed.

**Very Similar**: When content is 85%+ similar, we can reuse most of the work and just tweak the response for the new context. This saves us about 80% of the AI processing cost.

**Somewhat Similar**: If it's 70-85% similar, we enhance the prompt with what we learned from similar content, then make a shorter, cheaper AI call.

**Completely New**: Only when content is less than 70% similar do we do full AI processing from scratch.

## Different Models, Different Rules

We're smart about which AI models we use and how long we cache their responses. GPT-3.5 responses stay cached for 48 hours since it's cheaper, while GPT-4 responses only stay for 24 hours since it's more expensive. Custom models for specialized tasks can stay cached for a full week.

## Keeping Costs Down

We group similar requests together and process them in batches, which is much more efficient than individual calls. We also cache common prompt templates and compress large responses before storing them. The goal is to reduce our AI costs by 60-80% while keeping response times fast.
