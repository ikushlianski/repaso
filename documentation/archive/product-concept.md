# Repaso: AI-Powered Flashcard Platform

## Core Concept

A simple, beautiful flashcard platform where AI generates study materials from any content you provide. Built for anyone who wants to learn and remember facts effectively.

## What It Does

You give it content (text, documents, websites) and it creates flashcards automatically. Then it helps you study those flashcards using proven spaced repetition techniques to maximize retention.

## Target Users

Anyone who needs to learn and remember factual information:
- Students studying for exams
- Language learners building vocabulary  
- Professionals learning new skills
- Anyone preparing for certifications or tests

## Key Features

**AI Content Processing**: Upload documents, paste text, or provide links - AI extracts key facts and creates flashcards

**Smart Study System**: Uses spaced repetition to show you cards at optimal intervals for retention

**Beautiful Interface**: Clean, intuitive design that makes studying enjoyable rather than a chore

**Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on phone, tablet, and computer

## Future Vision

**Language School Integration**: Words and phrases from language lessons automatically become flashcards for students to practice

**Universal Learning Platform**: Expand beyond flashcards to support various learning materials and methods

## What Makes It Different

Most flashcard apps require you to manually create cards (tedious) or use pre-made decks (generic). We use AI to instantly create quality personalized flashcards from your specific learning materials.

The focus is on simplicity and effectiveness - not enterprise features or complex workflows.

## Next Steps

1. Define the minimum viable product
2. Understand user workflows and pain points  
3. Design the core user experience
4. Plan technical implementation
