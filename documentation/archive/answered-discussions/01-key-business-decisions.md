# Key Business Decisions for B2B Pivot

## Critical Decisions Needed

### 1. Primary Market Focus (Choose ONE)

**Option A: Corporate Training Generalist**
- Pros: Larger market ($366B), established budgets, clear ROI
- Cons: Longer sales cycles, need enterprise features, complex integrations
- GTM: Enterprise sales team, trade shows, content marketing

**Option B: Developer Training Specialist** 
- Pros: You understand this market, higher willingness to pay, shorter sales cycles
- Cons: Smaller market, more competitive, individual vs corporate budgets
- GTM: Developer communities, product-led growth, content marketing

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Start with developer market for faster validation/revenue
- Expand to corporate training once proven
- Risk: Lack of focus, diluted messaging

I struggle to understand how we would sell our software to customers that wanna train thier personnel. they usually go to some conferences but will people be willing to invest in flashcards?
What do you think?

**My Recommendation**: Start with developers (faster validation) → expand to corporate
**Your Decision Needed**: Which resonates most with your expertise and network? hybrid approach

### 2. Product Positioning

**Option A: "AI-Powered Corporate Training Platform"**
- Compete with Cornerstone, Docebo, TalentLMS
- Need full LMS features, enterprise integrations
- Higher deal sizes ($50K+) but longer sales cycles

**Option B: "Developer Knowledge Retention Tool"**  
- Compete with Pluralsight, Udemy, coding bootcamps
- Focus on technical skill retention and certification prep
- Smaller deals ($1K-10K) but faster acquisition

**Option C: "AI Content Generation for Learning Teams"**
- Positioning as a tool that plugs into existing LMS/training programs
- API-first, integration-focused approach
- Partner with existing LMS providers

**My Recommendation**: Option B → Option C → Option A progression
**Your Decision Needed**: What positioning feels most natural to you?

I wanna build an LMS myself too. and this repaso tool would be one of those platform elements. let's talk.

### 3. Initial Product Scope

**Minimum Viable B2B Product:**
- [ ] AI card generation from text/documents
- [ ] Team management (admin panel, user invites)
- [ ] Basic analytics (completion rates, performance)
- [ ] SSO integration (Google, Microsoft)
- [ ] Mobile app

**Enterprise Must-Haves:**
- [ ] Advanced reporting and dashboards  
- [ ] SCORM/xAPI compliance tracking
- [ ] Custom branding options
- [ ] API access for integrations
- [ ] Role-based permissions

**Developer-Specific Features:**
- [ ] Code syntax highlighting in cards
- [ ] GitHub integration for documentation
- [ ] Certification prep templates
- [ ] Progress streaks and gamification
- [ ] Community features (shared decks)

**Your Decision Needed**: Which feature set should we build first?

i don't wanna do enterprise now. i would like to focus on developer knowlwedge management but build a platform taht would allow any sphere of knowledge to be managed. accent on code and mobile availabeility like anki, so that code-centric cards would be processing fine and visible. 

### 4. Pricing Strategy

**Current Proposal**:
- Starter: $25/user/month (min 10 users)
- Professional: $50/user/month (min 25 users)  
- Enterprise: $100/user/month (min 100 users)

**Alternative Developer-Focused**:
- Individual: $19/month  
- Team: $39/user/month (min 5 users)
- Enterprise: $99/user/month (min 50 users)

**Questions**:
- Should we offer individual plans for developers? yes
- What's the right minimum user count? none
- Annual vs monthly billing discount? annual discuount

i think it's too early to talk pricing.

### 5. Go-to-Market Strategy

1. Build developer community through content. love it
2. Product-led growth with freemium tier
3. Word-of-mouth and referral programs
