# US020 - Background Migration Processing

As a user with a large flashcard collection, I want my import to process in the background so I can continue using the app while my data is being transferred.

## Requirements

### Background Processing
- Queue large imports for background processing
- Continue using app while import runs
- Real-time progress updates and notifications
- Ability to pause and resume imports
- Automatic retry for failed operations

### Progress Tracking
- Visual progress bar with percentage complete
- Estimated time remaining
- Current operation status (parsing, importing, processing)
- Number of cards processed vs. total
- Error count and details

### User Experience
- Start using app immediately after upload
- Receive notification when import completes
- View import status in dedicated section
- Access partially imported content during processing
- Cancel import if needed

### Error Handling
- Detailed error logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages
- Ability to retry failed imports
- Partial import recovery
- Support for corrupted or invalid files

## User Stories

1. As a user with thousands of cards, I want background processing so I don't have to wait for my import to complete
2. As a user, I want to see progress updates so I know my import is working
3. As a user, I want to use the app while importing so I can start learning immediately
4. As a user, I want to be notified when import finishes so I know when my full collection is ready
5. As a user, I want to retry failed imports so I can fix issues and try again
6. As a user, I want to cancel long-running imports so I'm not stuck waiting

## Business Value

- Enables migration of very large collections
- Improves user experience for power users
- Reduces perceived wait time
- Allows immediate app usage after upload
- Handles edge cases and errors gracefully
