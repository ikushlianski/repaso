# Basic Cross-Device Sync - Learning Everywhere You Go

Your cards should follow you wherever you learn. Whether you're reviewing on your laptop during lunch or catching up on your phone during your commute, everything stays perfectly in sync without you having to think about it.

## Why This Changes Everything

The moment you can seamlessly move between devices, your learning becomes part of your daily flow instead of something confined to your desk. Start a study session on your computer, continue it on your phone, and pick up exactly where you left off. No manual exports, no version conflicts, just your learning content ready when you are.

## What You Get

**Effortless Synchronization**
Your cards, progress, and study history sync automatically across all your devices. Create a card on your laptop and it's immediately available on your phone. Mark a card as difficult during your morning review and that information is there when you study tonight on a different device.

**Mobile-First Web Experience**
The Progressive Web App gives you an app-like experience right in your mobile browser. It loads fast, works offline when you need it to, and sends gentle reminders when it's time to study. No app store downloads required, but all the convenience you expect.

**Smart Offline Access**
Internet connection spotty? No problem. The system intelligently keeps your most recent and most important cards available offline, so you can keep studying even when connectivity is unreliable. Everything syncs up seamlessly once you're back online.

## The Foundation for Growth

This isn't just about convenienceâ€”it's about removing every possible friction point that could interrupt your learning momentum. When your study system works seamlessly across every device you use, you're more likely to study consistently, and consistent study is what drives real learning outcomes.

## What Success Looks Like

Users naturally adopt multi-device studying patterns because the experience feels effortless. Sync happens invisibly and reliably. The mobile web experience feels as smooth as a native app. Most importantly, users study more frequently because their learning system is always accessible, no matter where they are or what device they have.
