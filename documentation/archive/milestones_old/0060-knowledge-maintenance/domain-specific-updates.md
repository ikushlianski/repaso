# Domain-Specific Update Strategies

## Different Fields, Different Needs

Each domain has unique characteristics that affect how we should handle updates. Programming changes quickly with new frameworks and best practices, while medical information requires careful verification and regulatory compliance.

## Programming and Technology

**Update Frequency**: Check daily for major frameworks, weekly for others
**Sources**: Official documentation, GitHub releases, Stack Overflow trends, developer blogs
**Change Types**: New features, deprecated functions, security updates, best practices
**User Impact**: High - outdated programming knowledge can lead to security issues
**Notification Priority**: High for security updates, medium for feature changes

## Medicine and Healthcare

**Update Frequency**: Check weekly for clinical updates, daily for urgent safety information
**Sources**: Medical journals, FDA updates, clinical trial results, medical news
**Change Types**: Treatment protocols, drug interactions, safety warnings, research findings
**User Impact**: Critical - outdated medical information can be dangerous
**Notification Priority**: Immediate for safety issues, high for treatment changes

## Science and Research

**Update Frequency**: Check monthly for most fields, weekly for rapidly evolving areas
**Sources**: Research papers, scientific journals, institutional updates, conference proceedings
**Change Types**: New discoveries, methodology updates, paradigm shifts, research findings
**User Impact**: Medium - important for staying current but not immediately critical
**Notification Priority**: Medium for most updates, high for major discoveries

## Language Learning

**Update Frequency**: Check monthly for usage changes, daily for current events
**Sources**: Language learning resources, native speaker communities, cultural updates
**Change Types**: Usage changes, new vocabulary, cultural context, regional variations
**User Impact**: Medium - important for accurate communication but not critical
**Notification Priority**: Low for most updates, medium for significant usage changes

## Current Events and News

**Update Frequency**: Check daily for breaking news, hourly for major events
**Sources**: News outlets, official announcements, government updates, social media
**Change Types**: Policy changes, event updates, new developments, corrections
**User Impact**: High - outdated current events information can be misleading
**Notification Priority**: High for major events, medium for policy changes

## Customization Options

**Domain Selection**: Choose which domains you want to track for updates
**Update Frequency**: Set different frequencies for different domains
**Source Preferences**: Select which sources you trust for each domain
**Notification Settings**: Customize notifications based on domain importance
**Learning Goals**: Specify what you're trying to learn in each domain
