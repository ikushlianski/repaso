# Waitlist Landing Page for Anki Users

As a frustrated Anki user who wants a modern flashcard experience, I need a compelling landing page that shows me exactly what Repaso offers so that I can join the waitlist and be notified when it launches.

## The First Impression That Matters

When Anki users discover Repaso, they need to immediately understand this is built for them. The landing page should feel like coming home - familiar enough that they recognize their problems being solved, but exciting enough to make them want something better.

The page needs to demonstrate the key improvements that matter most: AI card generation that saves hours of work, a beautiful interface that doesn't hurt to look at, and seamless importing of their existing Anki collections so their years of work aren't lost.

## What Success Looks Like

Anki users visit the page, immediately see their pain points reflected back at them, watch the AI demo and think "this is exactly what I've been waiting for," then join the waitlist with clear expectations about timeline and early access benefits. They leave feeling excited about the future of their flashcard workflow rather than frustrated with current limitations.
