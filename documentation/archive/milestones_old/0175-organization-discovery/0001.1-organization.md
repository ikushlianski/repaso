# 0001.3 - Organization

How you structure your knowledge so it makes sense and stays manageable as it grows.

## Organizing Your Learning

### Deck Structure That Scales
- Hierarchical deck organization (2-3 levels deep initially)
- Create, rename, and delete decks
- Move decks within the hierarchy
- Visual indication of deck size and due cards
- Deck description and metadata

### Tags That Connect Ideas
- Add multiple tags to cards
- Create, edit, and delete tags
- Filter cards by tags
- Tag autocomplete when adding
- Tag management interface
- Tag hierarchies (optional for v1)

### Finding What You Need
- Full-text search across all cards
- Filter by deck, tag, card type
- Filter by card status (new, learning, review)
- Save common searches
- Sort by various attributes (created date, due date)

### Managing at Scale
- Select multiple cards for operations
- Batch tagging
- Batch move between decks
- Batch edit common fields
- Export selected cards

## Why Organization Matters

As your knowledge grows, you need ways to find and focus on what matters. Good organization isn't about being neatâ€”it's about making your learning more effective. When you can quickly find related concepts or focus on specific topics, you learn faster and retain more.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to organize my cards into decks so I can group related information
2. As a user, I want to create nested decks so I can establish a logical hierarchy of knowledge
3. As a user, I want to tag my cards so I can create flexible, cross-deck categorizations
4. As a user, I want to search for specific content so I can quickly find relevant cards
5. As a user, I want to filter cards by various attributes so I can focus on specific subsets
6. As a user, I want to perform operations on multiple cards at once so I can efficiently manage my collection
