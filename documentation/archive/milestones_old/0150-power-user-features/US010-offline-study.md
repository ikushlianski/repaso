# US010 - Offline Study Capability

As a user who studies in various locations, I want to continue learning even without internet connection so my learning never gets interrupted.

## User Story

Learning happens everywhereâ€”on the subway, in coffee shops, during commutes. I shouldn't have to stop learning just because I don't have internet. I want to download my decks and study anywhere, with everything syncing automatically when I'm back online.

## What Offline Study Gives You

### Offline Synchronization That Just Works
- Download decks for offline study
- Sync study progress when connection returns
- Handle conflicts when offline changes conflict
- Queue actions for later synchronization
- Indicate offline status clearly

### Offline Study Features That Feel Complete
- Full study session functionality offline
- Access to all downloaded content
- Create and edit cards offline
- Take notes and ask questions (queued)
- View statistics and progress

### Smart Sync That Stays Out of Your Way
- Automatic sync when connection available
- Manual sync option for users
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous changes
- Bandwidth-aware sync for mobile users
- Background sync without interrupting study

### Data Management That Makes Sense
- Choose which decks to download
- Manage offline storage space
- Update offline content when online
- Clear offline data when needed
- Sync status and progress indicators

## Why This Matters

When learning is truly portable, it becomes a habit. You can study during any downtime, in any location, without worrying about connectivity. This removes one of the biggest barriers to consistent learning.
