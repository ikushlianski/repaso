# Basic Card Creation Interface

As someone learning new concepts, I need a simple and intuitive way to create flashcards so that I can quickly capture information without being overwhelmed by complex interfaces.

## The Core Need

When you encounter something new that you want to remember, the barrier to creating a flashcard should be practically nonexistent. You click "New Card" and immediately start typing your content. The system gets out of your way and lets you focus entirely on organizing your thoughts.

The card editor should feel natural and immediate. You see exactly what your card will look like when you're studying it, with no surprises or hidden formatting. Everything auto-saves as you work, which means you never lose progress even if you get distracted or need to step away.

## What Success Looks Like

You can create a basic flashcard in under 30 seconds from the moment you decide you need one. The interface is clean and distraction-free, showing only what you need to see right now. The editor responds instantly to your typing, and formatting options are available but never intrusive.

Most importantly, the card creation process should disappear into the background. The focus stays on your content and your learning, not on figuring out how to use the software.
