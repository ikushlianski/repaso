# Cloze Deletion Cards

As someone learning complex concepts and processes, I need cloze deletion cards so that I can test my understanding of information within its natural context.

## Learning in Context

Sometimes you need to understand how pieces fit together rather than isolated facts. Cloze deletion lets you take a complete sentence or passage and hide key parts, testing your ability to fill in the blanks while seeing the surrounding context.

## What Success Looks Like

You can easily select text to hide, create multiple blanks in a single card, and study each blank independently. The context remains visible, helping you understand relationships between concepts.
