# Question & Answer Cards

As a learner studying facts and concepts, I need traditional front/back flashcards so that I can test my recall of specific information in a structured way.

## The Classic Learning Pattern

Sometimes the best approach is the timeless one. You have a question or prompt on the front, and the complete answer on the back. This works perfectly for vocabulary, definitions, historical facts, or any knowledge that has a clear question-answer relationship.

## What Success Looks Like

You can quickly create cards where the question is distinct from the answer, with clear visual separation. The study experience shows only the question first, letting you think through your response before revealing the answer.
