# Bulk Operations & Management

As someone managing large collections of cards, I need efficient bulk operations so that I can organize, update, and maintain my cards without repetitive manual work.

## Scaling Your Collection

Once you have hundreds of cards, individual edits become inefficient. You need to tag multiple cards at once, move entire topics between decks, or update formatting across related cards.

## What Success Looks Like

You can select multiple cards easily, perform batch operations with clear confirmation, and manage large collections efficiently. Progress indicators show operations in progress, and undo options provide safety.
