# Create and Organize Decks

As someone starting to learn with Repaso, I need a simple way to create and organize my card collections so that I can group related topics and keep my learning materials structured.

## The Organizational Foundation

Before you can create flashcards, you need somewhere to put them. Decks are your containers for related cards - maybe one for Spanish vocabulary, another for software engineering concepts, or one for your upcoming certification exam.

Creating a deck should be as simple as naming it and starting to add cards. The system should suggest logical organization patterns while staying out of your way when you have your own ideas.

## What Success Looks Like

You can create a new deck in seconds with just a name and optional description. Decks are visually distinct and easy to identify. You can organize them by subject, difficulty, or any system that makes sense for your learning goals.
