# Deck Creation Experience

## Starting Your Collection

You click "Create New Deck" from your dashboard. A simple modal appears asking for the deck name - that's all that's required. You type "Spanish Verbs" and hit enter. The deck is created instantly and you're taken to its empty state.

## Optional Details

If you want to add more context, there's an optional description field. Maybe you write "Common Spanish verbs for everyday conversation" to remind yourself later what this deck covers.

## Immediate Readiness

The moment your deck exists, you see an inviting "Add Your First Card" button. The deck appears in your collection immediately, and you can start building content right away.

## Visual Identity

Your new deck gets a subtle color or icon to help distinguish it from others. This happens automatically but you can customize it if you prefer specific visual cues for different subjects.
