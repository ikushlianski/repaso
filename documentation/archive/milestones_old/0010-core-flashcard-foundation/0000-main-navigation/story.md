# Main Navigation & App Shell

As a user entering the application, I need clear navigation and consistent layout so that I can easily move between different areas and understand where I am at all times.

## The Foundation Experience

When you open Repaso, you should immediately understand the structure of the application. The main navigation shows your key areas - your decks, study sessions, settings - and makes it obvious how to get where you need to go.

The layout should feel familiar and consistent no matter which part of the app you're using. Whether you're browsing cards, creating content, or reviewing your progress, the core navigation and page structure remain predictable and accessible.

## What Success Looks Like

You can navigate between major sections without thinking about it. The current location is always clear through visual indicators. The interface adapts gracefully to different screen sizes while maintaining usability and visual hierarchy.
