# Navigation User Experience

## First Impression
You log in and see a clean, organized interface. The main navigation is immediately visible - typically a sidebar or top bar showing "My Decks", "Study", "Browse", and "Settings". Your username or avatar is clearly displayed.

## Clear Orientation
No matter where you are in the app, you can see your current location highlighted in the navigation. Breadcrumbs show your path through nested sections like "My Decks > Spanish Vocabulary > Verbs".

## Effortless Movement
Clicking any navigation item takes you there instantly. The layout shifts to show the new content while keeping the navigation structure consistent. You never lose your sense of place or wonder how to get back.

## Responsive Adaptation
On mobile, the navigation collapses to a hamburger menu or bottom tab bar. The hierarchy remains the same, just adapted for touch interaction and smaller screens.
