# Rich Text Formatting & Markdown

As someone creating educational content, I need rich formatting options so that I can emphasize key information and create visually clear learning materials.

## Making Information Clear

Different concepts need different visual treatment. Sometimes you need to bold the crucial term, italicize a subtle distinction, or create lists when information has multiple parts. Markdown support lets power users work efficiently with familiar syntax.

## What Success Looks Like

Formatting tools are available when needed but never intrusive. Both visual formatting and Markdown input work seamlessly, with real-time preview showing exactly how content will appear during study.
