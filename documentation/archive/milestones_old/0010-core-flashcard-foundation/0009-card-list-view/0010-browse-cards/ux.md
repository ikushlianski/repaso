# Card Browsing Experience

## Entering Your Collection

You click on your "Spanish Verbs" deck and see a clean list of all your cards. Each card shows a preview of the question and answer, along with metadata like when you last studied it or how difficult you found it.

## Quick Actions

Every card has immediate actions available - study this card now, edit its content, or add it to a study queue. You don't need to open a separate page for simple operations.

## Finding Specific Cards

The search box at the top lets you type "subjunctive" and instantly see only cards containing that term. Filter buttons help you show only difficult cards, recently added cards, or cards due for review.

## Bulk Management

When you need to organize multiple cards, checkboxes appear next to each card. You can select several and tag them all, move them to another deck, or add them to a study session together.
