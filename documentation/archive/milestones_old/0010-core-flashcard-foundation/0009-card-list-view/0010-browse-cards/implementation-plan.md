# Implementation Plan

## Core Components
- `CardList` - Main card browsing interface
- `CardPreview` - Individual card display component
- `SearchFilter` - Search and filtering controls
- `BulkActions` - Multi-select operations

## Technical Steps
1. Create card list view with pagination/virtual scrolling
2. Implement search functionality with debounced input
3. Add filtering by difficulty, date, tags
4. Build card preview component with actions
5. Add bulk selection and operations

## Data Requirements
```
CardPreview {
  id: string
  question: string (truncated)
  answer: string (snippet)
  difficulty: number
  lastStudied?: Date
  tags: string[]
  cardType: 'qa' | 'cloze'
}
```

## Performance Considerations
- Virtual scrolling for large card collections
- Debounced search (300ms)
- Paginated API responses (50 cards per page)
