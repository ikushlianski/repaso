# Browse and Manage Cards

As someone with an existing collection of cards, I need to easily browse, search, and organize my cards so that I can find specific content and manage my learning materials effectively.

## Finding Your Content

Once you have cards in your deck, you need ways to see what you've created, find specific cards when you need them, and get an overview of your learning materials. This isn't just about storage - it's about having confidence that you can locate any piece of knowledge when you need it.

The card list should give you multiple ways to view and organize your content, from simple chronological lists to filtered views by difficulty or topic.

## What Success Looks Like

You can quickly scan through your cards, search for specific content, and filter by various criteria. Each card shows enough preview information to identify it without opening it. Actions like editing, studying, or organizing cards are immediately accessible.
