# Duplicate Detection System

As someone who creates many cards over time, I need automatic duplicate detection so that my collection stays clean without manual oversight.

## Keeping Collections Clean

When you're actively learning, you might create similar cards without realizing it. The system should catch potential duplicates and give you options to merge, keep separate, or improve the content.

## What Success Looks Like

Duplicate detection happens in the background without interrupting your flow. When matches are found, you get clear options to handle them appropriately. Your collection stays organized automatically.
