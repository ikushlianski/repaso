# Card Organization & Tagging

As someone building a large collection of cards, I need effective organization tools so that I can find and study specific topics without getting overwhelmed.

## Staying Organized at Scale

As your collection grows, you need ways to group related cards, find specific topics quickly, and create focused study sessions. Tags provide flexible organization that adapts to how your understanding evolves.

## What Success Looks Like

Tagging feels natural and immediate. Auto-complete helps maintain consistency. You can filter your collection by tags to create focused study sessions on exactly what you need to review.
