# US040 - Study Session Customization

As a user with different learning needs, I want to customize my study sessions so I can optimize my learning experience for different subjects and time constraints.

## User Story

Learning isn't one-size-fits-all. Sometimes I need to cram before an exam. Sometimes I want to focus on new material. Sometimes I only have 10 minutes, and sometimes I can study for an hour. I want the system to adapt to my needs, not the other way around.

## What You Can Customize

### Session Configuration That Fits Your Life
- Set daily limits for new and review cards
- Choose study order (new first, review first, mixed)
- Select specific decks or tags to focus on
- Set session time limits and card count limits
- Configure difficulty rating options

### Study Modes for Different Situations
- Normal mode with full spaced repetition
- Cram mode for intensive review before exams
- Learning mode for new cards only
- Review mode for due cards only
- Custom mode with user-defined rules

### Progress Tracking That Motivates
- Real-time session statistics
- Time spent per card and per session
- Accuracy rates and improvement trends
- Streak tracking and motivation
- Session history and patterns

### Accessibility That Includes Everyone
- High contrast mode for better visibility
- Larger text options for readability
- Keyboard-only navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Voice commands for hands-free study

## Why This Matters

When the system adapts to you instead of forcing you to adapt to it, learning becomes more enjoyable and effective. You can study when and how it works for you, not when and how the system thinks you should.
