# Browser Extension Content Capture UX

## Core UX Principles

**Invisible Integration**: The extension should feel like a natural part of the browsing experience, not an interruption.

**One-Click Capture**: Content capture should be as simple as clicking a button - no forms, no complex flows.

**Instant Feedback**: Users should immediately know their content was captured and where it went.

## Visual Design

### Extension Icon
- **Subtle but Visible**: Small, unobtrusive icon in browser toolbar
- **Status Indication**: Icon changes color/shape to show capture status
- **Hover State**: Quick preview of what will be captured

### Capture Button
- **Floating Action**: Appears on hover over content areas
- **Clear Labeling**: "Save to Repaso" or simple "+" icon
- **Contextual Placement**: Near the main content, not hidden in menus

## User Flow

### 1. Content Discovery
- User browses normally
- Extension automatically detects content-rich areas
- Subtle highlight or indicator appears on hover

### 2. One-Click Capture
- User clicks capture button
- Content is instantly saved to inbox
- Brief confirmation appears (2-3 seconds max)

### 3. Optional Enhancement
- Quick note/tag option appears briefly
- User can add context or skip
- Content disappears from view once captured

## Interaction Patterns

### Desktop Experience
- **Hover to Reveal**: Capture button appears on content hover
- **Click to Capture**: Single click saves content
- **Right-Click Menu**: Alternative capture method
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Quick capture with hotkey

### Mobile Experience
- **Long Press**: Hold on content to reveal capture option
- **Share Menu**: Integrate with native share functionality
- **Floating Button**: Persistent capture button for easy access

## Feedback Mechanisms

### Success States
- **Brief Toast**: "Saved to Repaso" with checkmark
- **Icon Animation**: Extension icon briefly pulses
- **Content Fade**: Captured content subtly dims

### Error States
- **Gentle Error**: "Couldn't save - try again" with retry option
- **Offline Mode**: "Saved locally - will sync when online"
- **Limit Reached**: "Inbox full - process some content first"

## Content Detection

### Smart Recognition
- **Article Detection**: Automatically identify main content
- **Video Support**: Capture video metadata and transcripts
- **Image Recognition**: Save images with context
- **PDF Handling**: Direct PDF capture and processing

### User Control
- **Selection Override**: Let users select specific content
- **Exclusion Rules**: Skip certain page elements
- **Content Preview**: Show what will be captured before saving

## Settings Integration

### Minimal Configuration
- **Default Behavior**: Works out of the box
- **Quick Settings**: Essential options only
- **Advanced Options**: Hidden behind "More Settings"

### Personalization
- **Capture Mode**: Immediate, question-based, or inbox
- **Content Types**: Choose what to capture automatically
- **Notification Preferences**: Control feedback frequency

## Cross-Browser Consistency

### Unified Experience
- **Same Functionality**: Identical features across all browsers
- **Consistent Design**: Visual consistency regardless of browser
- **Synchronized Settings**: Settings sync across all devices

### Browser-Specific Optimizations
- **Chrome**: Full feature set with advanced capabilities
- **Firefox**: Core features with privacy focus
- **Safari**: iOS integration and native feel
- **Edge**: Microsoft ecosystem integration

## Performance Considerations

### Lightweight Operation
- **Minimal Resource Usage**: Extension doesn't slow down browsing
- **Background Processing**: Content processing happens asynchronously
- **Smart Caching**: Reduce repeated processing of similar content

### Offline Capability
- **Local Storage**: Save content when offline
- **Sync Queue**: Process when connection restored
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle sync conflicts gracefully

## Accessibility

### Inclusive Design
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support
- **Screen Reader**: Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- **High Contrast**: Support for high contrast modes
- **Font Scaling**: Respects user's font size preferences

### Error Prevention
- **Clear Messaging**: Simple, jargon-free error messages
- **Undo Capability**: Easy way to undo accidental captures
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: For destructive actions only
