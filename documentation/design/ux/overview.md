# UX Architecture Overview

## The Challenge

Users want to feel in control of their learning journey, but we also need to optimize for cost and performance. We need to design interfaces that give users the impression of control while actually serving them the most efficient solution.

## Our Solution

**Smart Prompting**: Suggest relevant topics and prompts based on what users are learning
**Perceived Control**: Let users feel like they're driving the card creation process
**Intelligent Caching**: Serve cached content when prompts are similar to existing ones
**Seamless Experience**: Users get what they want without knowing about the optimization

## Key UX Principles

**User Agency**: Users feel like they're in control of their learning
**Intelligent Assistance**: We guide them toward good choices without being pushy
**Transparent Optimization**: When we serve cached content, we're honest about it
**Progressive Disclosure**: Show complexity only when users need it
**Contextual Help**: Provide guidance exactly when users need it

## Why This Matters

**Better Engagement**: Users feel more invested when they think they're driving the process
**Cost Efficiency**: We serve cached content when possible without users knowing
**Learning Guidance**: We help users discover what they should learn next
**Reduced Friction**: Users don't have to think about complex AI model selection
**Trust Building**: Users trust the system more when they feel in control
