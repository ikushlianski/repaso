# UI Architecture Overview

## Multi-Platform Strategy

We're building Repaso across multiple platforms to meet users wherever they are. Each platform has unique characteristics and user expectations that we need to design for.

## Platform-Specific Considerations

**Web**: Primary platform with full feature set, accessible from any device
**Mobile**: Native apps for iOS and Android with touch-optimized interfaces
**Desktop**: Native desktop apps for power users and offline functionality

## Design Principles

**Consistency**: Core functionality works the same across all platforms
**Platform Native**: Each platform feels native to its ecosystem
**Progressive Enhancement**: Web works everywhere, native apps add value
**Offline-First**: All platforms work without internet connection
**Sync Seamless**: Data syncs perfectly across all platforms

## User Experience Goals

**Familiar**: Users feel comfortable on their preferred platform
**Efficient**: Each platform optimized for its unique use cases
**Reliable**: Consistent experience regardless of platform
**Accessible**: Works for users with different abilities and preferences
**Scalable**: Design system that grows with our feature set

## Technical Approach

**Shared Design System**: Common components and patterns across platforms
**Platform-Specific Implementation**: Native feel for each platform
**Responsive Design**: Web adapts to different screen sizes
**Progressive Web App**: Web app that works like native on mobile
**Cross-Platform Sync**: Seamless data synchronization across all platforms
