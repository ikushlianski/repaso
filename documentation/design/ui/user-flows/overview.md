# User Flow Architecture

## Cross-Platform User Journeys

Understanding how users move through the application across different platforms and contexts.

## Key User Flows

**Onboarding**: First-time user experience across all platforms
**Card Creation**: Creating flashcards with AI assistance
**Study Sessions**: Learning and reviewing flashcards
**Organization**: Managing decks and organizing content
**Sync**: Keeping data synchronized across devices

## Platform-Specific Flows

**Web**: Full-featured flows with advanced options
**Mobile**: Simplified flows optimized for touch
**Desktop**: Power user flows with keyboard shortcuts
**Cross-Platform**: Flows that work seamlessly across devices

## Flow Considerations

**Context Switching**: How users move between different parts of the app
**State Management**: Maintaining state across different screens
**Error Handling**: Graceful handling of errors and edge cases
**Offline Support**: Flows that work without internet connection
**Performance**: Optimizing flows for speed and efficiency

## User Experience

**Intuitive Navigation**: Easy to find and access features
**Consistent Patterns**: Similar flows work similarly across platforms
**Progressive Disclosure**: Show complexity only when needed
**Feedback**: Clear feedback for user actions
**Recovery**: Easy ways to recover from mistakes

## Technical Implementation

**State Management**: Consistent state across all platforms
**Navigation**: Platform-appropriate navigation patterns
**Data Flow**: How data flows through the application
**Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling
**Performance**: Optimizing flows for speed and efficiency
