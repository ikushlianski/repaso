# Conflict Resolution Strategy

## The Challenge

When users make changes on multiple devices, we need to resolve conflicts intelligently without losing data or creating confusion. This is especially important for our knowledge maintenance features where AI updates might conflict with user changes.

## Conflict Types

**Simple Conflicts**: Same field changed on different devices
**Complex Conflicts**: Related fields changed in incompatible ways
**AI vs User**: AI updates conflicting with user modifications
**Structural Conflicts**: Changes to deck hierarchy or organization
**Content Conflicts**: Different versions of card content

## Resolution Strategies

**Last-Write-Wins**: For simple conflicts, use timestamp-based resolution
**User Resolution**: Present conflicts to users for manual resolution
**Smart Merging**: Automatically merge compatible changes
**AI Assistance**: Use AI to suggest conflict resolutions
**Rollback Options**: Allow users to revert to previous versions

## User Experience

**Conflict Notifications**: Clear indication when conflicts occur
**Resolution Interface**: Easy-to-use conflict resolution UI
**Change Visualization**: Show what changed and why
**Preview Mode**: See resolution before applying
**Bulk Resolution**: Handle multiple conflicts at once

## AI Integration

**Smart Suggestions**: AI suggests conflict resolutions based on context
**Change Analysis**: AI analyzes changes to determine compatibility
**User Learning**: Learn from user conflict resolution patterns
**Automatic Resolution**: Auto-resolve simple conflicts with high confidence
**Fallback Options**: Always provide manual resolution as backup

## Quality Assurance

**Conflict Testing**: Test conflict scenarios thoroughly
**User Feedback**: Learn from user conflict resolution behavior
**Resolution Metrics**: Track success rates of different strategies
**Continuous Improvement**: Refine conflict resolution based on data
**Edge Case Handling**: Handle unusual conflict scenarios gracefully
