## Market Gaps

### Knowledge Maintenance
Most flashcard apps create static knowledge that becomes outdated. Repaso keeps content current and relevant through AI-powered updates.

### Cross-Platform Experience
Many solutions lack seamless experience across devices or require manual syncing. Repaso works the same everywhere, with automatic syncing.

### Depth vs. Accessibility
Existing tools often sacrifice power for simplicity or vice versa. Repaso gives you depth when you need it, simplicity when you don't.

### Content Monetization
Few platforms let creators monetize their knowledge. Repaso's marketplace creates opportunities for knowledge entrepreneurs.

Repaso's unique approach ensures your cards evolve with changing information landscapes, so you're never learning outdated facts.

### AI Enhancement, Not Replacement
Unlike some AI tools that replace learning, Repaso uses AI to enhance your learning process, not substitute for it.

### Deep Organization
Our hierarchical organization solves the "flat knowledge" problem that plagues most flashcard systems.

### Balanced Learning Approach
We combine the science of spaced repetition with practical, real-world knowledge management that fits your life.
