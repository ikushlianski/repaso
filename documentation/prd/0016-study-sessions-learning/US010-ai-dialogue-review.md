# US010 - AI Dialogue During Review

As a user studying flashcards, I want to engage in contextual AI dialogues about specific cards so I can clarify concepts, ask follow-up questions, and evolve my understanding in real-time.

## User Story

When I'm reviewing a card and something doesn't make sense, I want to start a conversation with AI right there. I should be able to ask questions, get explanations, and even generate new cards from our discussion—all without losing my place in my study session.
