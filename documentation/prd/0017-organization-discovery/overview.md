# 0017 - Organization & Discovery

How you structure and find your knowledge as your collection grows from dozens to thousands of cards.

## Why This Matters

As your knowledge base grows, organization becomes critical. Without good organization, you end up with a pile of cards instead of a structured knowledge system. This milestone ensures you can always find what you need.

## What We're Building

### Organization That Scales
- Hierarchical deck structure that makes sense
- Flexible tagging system for cross-deck connections
- Smart search and filtering capabilities
- Bulk operations for efficient management
- Content relationships and hierarchies

### Discovery That Helps You Learn
- Find related concepts across your collection
- Discover knowledge gaps and connections
- Organize by source, topic, or custom criteria
- Visual indicators of progress and due cards
- Smart suggestions for study focus

## How This Fits Into Anki's Architecture

In Anki, this corresponds to the deck browser, tag system, and search functionality. We're building the organizational layer that makes large collections manageable.

## Success Metrics

- Deck and tag usage patterns
