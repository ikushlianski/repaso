# Local-First Data Architecture

## Data Storage Strategy

**Local Database**: Each device maintains a complete copy of user data
**Sync Database**: Cloud database for synchronization and backup
**Conflict Resolution**: Smart algorithms to handle simultaneous changes
**Data Ownership**: Users control their data and sync preferences

## Data Models

**Cards**: Core flashcard data with versioning and conflict resolution
**Decks**: Hierarchical organization with inheritance and permissions
**Study Progress**: Learning data that syncs across devices
**User Preferences**: Settings and customizations per device
**Sync Metadata**: Tracking changes, conflicts, and resolution

## Sync Strategy

**Incremental Sync**: Only sync changes, not entire datasets
**Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins for simple conflicts, user resolution for complex ones
**Offline Support**: Full functionality when disconnected
**Progressive Sync**: Sync most important data first
**Bandwidth Optimization**: Compress and batch sync operations

## Platform Considerations

**Web**: IndexedDB for local storage, WebRTC for peer-to-peer sync
**Mobile**: SQLite for local storage, native sync libraries
**Desktop**: Local database with cloud sync
**Cross-Platform**: Shared data models and sync protocols

## Security and Privacy

**Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
**User Control**: Users can disable sync or choose what to sync
**Privacy**: Data stays on user's device by default
**Compliance**: Meet data protection requirements
**Audit Trail**: Track all data changes and sync operations

## Performance Optimization

**Lazy Loading**: Load data as needed, not everything at once
**Caching**: Smart caching of frequently accessed data
**Compression**: Compress data for faster sync
**Background Sync**: Sync when device is idle
**Conflict Prevention**: Minimize conflicts through smart UI design
