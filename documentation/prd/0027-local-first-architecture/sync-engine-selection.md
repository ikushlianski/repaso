# Synchronization Engine Selection

## The Challenge

We need a robust synchronization engine that can handle complex data relationships, resolve conflicts intelligently, and work across multiple platforms (web, mobile, desktop). The choice of sync engine will fundamentally shape our architecture.

## Evaluation Criteria

**Platform Support**: Must work on web, iOS, Android, and desktop
**Conflict Resolution**: Smart handling of simultaneous changes
**Offline Support**: Full functionality without network connection
**Performance**: Fast sync and minimal resource usage
**Scalability**: Handle large datasets and many users
**Developer Experience**: Easy to integrate and maintain

## Engine Options

### Yjs (Yjs CRDT)
**Pros**: Mature, battle-tested, excellent conflict resolution, works everywhere
**Cons**: Complex setup, learning curve, can be resource-intensive
**Best For**: Real-time collaboration, complex data structures
**Platform Support**: Web, React Native, Electron

### Automerge
**Pros**: Simple API, good conflict resolution, JSON-based
**Cons**: Less mature, limited platform support, performance concerns
**Best For**: Simple data structures, rapid prototyping
**Platform Support**: Web, limited mobile support

### Electric SQL
**Pros**: SQL-based, real-time sync, excellent performance
**Cons**: Newer technology, limited ecosystem, complex setup
**Best For**: SQL-heavy applications, real-time data
**Platform Support**: Web, limited mobile support

### Custom Solution
**Pros**: Perfect fit for our needs, full control
**Cons**: High development cost, maintenance burden, testing complexity
**Best For**: Unique requirements, long-term control
**Platform Support**: Whatever we build

## Recommendation

**Yjs** appears to be the best fit for our needs because:
- Mature and battle-tested in production
- Excellent conflict resolution for complex data
- Works across all our target platforms
- Good performance and scalability
- Strong community and documentation
- Handles offline scenarios well

## Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1**: Start with Yjs for core data sync
**Phase 2**: Add custom conflict resolution for our specific needs
**Phase 3**: Optimize for our use cases and scale
**Phase 4**: Consider custom solutions if needed
