# 0025 - Interactive Study Environment

An intelligent learning system offering two distinct approaches to transform content into active learning: structured course-driven learning and flexible as-you-go learning.

## Milestone Overview

The Interactive Study Environment provides two complementary learning approaches that address different learning preferences and scenarios. Course-driven learning offers systematic, comprehensive learning experiences, while as-you-go learning enables flexible, real-time content processing.

## Business Impact

This milestone differentiates Repaso by offering both structured and flexible learning approaches, catering to diverse learning styles and use cases. It transforms any content into learning opportunities while giving users complete control over their learning experience.

**Rigid Hierarchy Enforcement**: All AI-generated content is automatically structured into clear, learnable hierarchies, preventing the chaos that typically comes with AI-generated flashcards. Users never face 3000-card piles or mixed subtopics.
