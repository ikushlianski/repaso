# 0025.2 - As-You-Go Learning

A flexible learning approach where users consume content in real-time, either through AI-first summarization or by processing content after consumption with interactive question generation and card creation.

## Overview

As-you-go learning provides two distinct workflows for content consumption and learning. Users can either consume AI-summarized content directly or process original content after consumption through interactive questioning and card generation.

## Key Features

- **AI-First Content Consumption**: Consume summarized points instead of original content
- **Post-Consumption Processing**: Add content after consumption for learning
- **Interactive Question Generation**: Ask questions about consumed content
