# US030 - Card Variations

As a user, I want multiple variations of the same concept so I can avoid memorizing specific card formats and instead truly understand the underlying knowledge.

## User Story

I want the system to generate different versions of cards covering the same concept. This prevents me from memorizing the exact wording of a card instead of understanding the actual knowledge. Different variations should test my understanding in different ways, making my learning more robust and preventing superficial memorization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- System generates multiple variations for each concept
- Variations test understanding in different ways
- Users can request additional variations
- Premium users get more variations than free users
- Variations maintain consistent quality standards
- Users can set preferences for variation styles

## Business Value

Improves learning effectiveness by preventing rote memorization and ensuring users truly understand concepts rather than just memorizing specific card formats.

## Technical Requirements

- Card variation generation algorithms
- Quality consistency across variations
- User preference tracking for variation styles
- Premium tier differentiation
- Variation quality scoring

## Success Metrics

- Learning effectiveness improvement
- User engagement with variations
- Premium conversion rates
- Card quality consistency across variations
