# US040 - Cross-Topic Parallels

As a user, I want the AI to draw parallels between topics I know and new topics I'm learning so I can build on my existing knowledge and understand new concepts more easily.

## User Story

When I'm learning ClickHouse but already know PostgreSQL, I want the AI to automatically draw parallels between these database systems. This helps me understand new concepts by relating them to what I already know, making learning more efficient and creating stronger mental connections between related topics.

## Acceptance Criteria

- AI automatically identifies parallels between known and new topics
- Parallels are integrated into card generation
- System uses user's knowledge levels to determine relevant parallels
- Parallels help explain new concepts using familiar examples
- No additional user input required for parallel generation

## Business Value

Accelerates learning by leveraging users' existing knowledge to explain new concepts, making the platform more effective and reducing the cognitive load of learning completely new topics.

## Technical Requirements

- Cross-topic relationship detection
- Parallel generation algorithms
- Knowledge level integration
- Context-aware card generation
- Topic relationship mapping

## Success Metrics

- Learning speed improvement with parallels
- User satisfaction with parallel explanations
- Knowledge retention across related topics
- User engagement with cross-topic learning
