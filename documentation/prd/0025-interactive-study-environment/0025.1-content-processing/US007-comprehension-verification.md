# US030 - Comprehension Verification

As a user, I want to answer comprehension questions about content before card generation so I can ensure I understand the material before creating learning cards.

## User Story

I want the system to ask me questions about the content I've imported to verify I actually understand what I'm learning. This prevents me from just generating cards without really grasping the material, which would be a waste of time. The questions should cover the key concepts and help me identify gaps in my understanding.

## Acceptance Criteria

- System presents comprehension questions after content analysis
- Questions cover key concepts from the content
- Users must answer questions before cards are generated
- System provides feedback on answers
- Questions adapt to content complexity and length
- Users can retry questions if they get them wrong
- System tracks comprehension progress over time

## Business Value

Ensures users actually learn from content rather than just generating cards without understanding. This creates a more effective learning experience and justifies the time investment in the platform.

## Technical Requirements

- Question generation from content analysis
- Answer validation and feedback system
- Integration with card generation workflow
- Progress tracking for comprehension
- Adaptive questioning based on user responses

## Success Metrics

- Comprehension question completion rate
- User understanding improvement
- Card quality correlation with comprehension scores
- User satisfaction with verification process
