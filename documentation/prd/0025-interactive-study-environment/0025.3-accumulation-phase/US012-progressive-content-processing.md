# US030 - Progressive Content Processing

As a user, I want to process content chapter by chapter for longer materials so I can ensure I understand each section before moving on to the next.

## User Story

When I upload a book or long document, I want the system to break it down into manageable chapters or sections. I should be able to work through each section individually, answering comprehension questions and generating cards before moving to the next part. This ensures I don't skip over important concepts and build my understanding progressively.

## Acceptance Criteria

- System automatically detects chapters or sections in long content
- Users can process content section by section
- Each section requires comprehension verification before proceeding
- Progress is tracked across all sections
- Users can return to previous sections for review
- System prevents skipping ahead without completing current section

## Business Value

Ensures thorough learning of complex materials by preventing users from rushing through content and missing important concepts, leading to better learning outcomes and user satisfaction.

## Technical Requirements

- Content segmentation algorithms
- Progress tracking across sections
- Section completion validation
- Navigation between sections
- Progress persistence and recovery

## Success Metrics

- Section completion rates
- Learning effectiveness by processing method
- User satisfaction with progressive approach
- Content comprehension improvement
