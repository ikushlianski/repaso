# US040 - Subject Hierarchy Management

As a user, I want to organize my learning by subjects and topics so I can structure my knowledge and get personalized AI assistance based on my expertise level in each area.

## User Story

I want to create a learning hierarchy where I can define subjects like "Databases" and then break them down into specific topics like "PostgreSQL", "MongoDB", and "ClickHouse".
