# US050 - Content Length Management

As a user, I want the system to guide me on appropriate content lengths so I can process information effectively without overwhelming the AI or creating poor quality cards.

## User Story

I want the system to help me understand what content lengths work best for learning. When I try to upload something too long, I want clear guidance on how to break it down into manageable pieces. For longer content like books, I want the system to suggest a chapter-by-chapter approach that ensures I actually learn each section before moving on.
