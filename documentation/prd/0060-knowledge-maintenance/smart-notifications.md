# Smart Notification System

## The Challenge

Without smart notifications, users would be bombarded with individual notifications for every card update, making the feature annoying rather than helpful. We need to group related changes and present them in a way that's actually useful.

## Our Solution

**Intelligent Grouping**: Group related updates together instead of sending individual notifications
**Contextual Summaries**: Provide meaningful summaries of what changed and why
**Priority Filtering**: Show only the most important changes, not every minor update
**Timing Optimization**: Send notifications at times when users are most likely to engage

## Notification Types

**Daily Digest**: Summary of all updates from the past 24 hours
**Weekly Summary**: Comprehensive overview of changes from the past week
**Urgent Updates**: Immediate notifications for critical changes that affect safety or accuracy
**Topic Alerts**: Notifications when specific topics you care about get updated
**Deck Summaries**: Updates grouped by deck or subject area

## Smart Grouping

**Related Changes**: Group updates that affect the same topic or concept
**Source Grouping**: Group updates from the same source or event
**Timing Grouping**: Group updates that happened around the same time
**Impact Grouping**: Group updates by how significant they are

## User Experience

**Clear Summaries**: Easy-to-understand explanations of what changed
**Visual Comparisons**: Side-by-side view of old vs. new information
**Source Attribution**: Clear indication of where new information came from
**Action Options**: Easy ways to approve, reject, or modify updates
**Learning Context**: Explain why changes matter for your learning goals

## Notification Delivery

**In-App Notifications**: Non-intrusive notifications within the app
**Email Summaries**: Optional email digests for users who prefer them
**Mobile Push**: Smart push notifications for urgent updates only
**Dashboard Widget**: Overview of recent updates on your main dashboard
