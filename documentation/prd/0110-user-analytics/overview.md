# 0110 - User Analytics

Understanding how people actually use Repaso so we can make it better. This isn't about tracking everythingâ€”it's about learning what helps people learn.

## Why This Matters

Every feature we build should make learning more effective. But how do we know if we're succeeding? User analytics give us the insights to understand what's working and what isn't. We're not just collecting data for the sake of it; we're building a feedback loop that makes the product better for everyone.

The goal isn't to optimize for engagement at any cost. It's to understand the learning patterns that lead to real retention and knowledge building. When someone consistently studies and actually remembers what they learn, that's success.

## What We're Tracking

### Learning Behavior Patterns
We need to see how people actually study. Are they completing their sessions? Are they coming back consistently? Which cards are they struggling with? This tells us if our spaced repetition algorithm is working and where we need to adjust.

The key is understanding the difference between busy activity and actual learning. Someone might spend hours in the app, but if they're not retaining information, we need to know why.

### Feature Adoption and Usage
Which features do people actually use? Are they creating cards manually or relying on AI generation? Do they use the AI dialogue during study? Are they organizing their content or just dumping everything in one deck?

This helps us prioritize development. If a feature we spent months building isn't being used, we need to understand why. Maybe it's too hard to find, or maybe it doesn't solve a real problem.

### Content Quality and Effectiveness
Not all cards are created equal. Some cards help people learn faster, others slow them down. We need to identify what makes a card effective so we can guide users toward creating better content.

This is especially important for AI-generated content. We want to understand which prompts and approaches lead to the most effective cards.

### User Journey and Onboarding
How do people discover Repaso? What makes them stick around after the first week? Where do they get stuck during onboarding? Understanding the user journey helps us remove friction and guide people toward success.

The first few days are critical. If someone doesn't see value quickly, they'll leave. But if we can get them to their first "aha" moment, they're much more likely to become long-term users.

## Getting Started

This builds on the core flashcard system and AI features. We need users creating and studying cards before we can understand their patterns.

## How We'll Know It's Working

We're looking for insights that drive product decisions. Are users completing more study sessions after we improve the interface? Are they creating better cards after we enhance the AI? Are they sticking around longer after we fix onboarding?

The real test is whether our analytics help us build features that actually improve learning outcomes, not just increase time spent in the app.
