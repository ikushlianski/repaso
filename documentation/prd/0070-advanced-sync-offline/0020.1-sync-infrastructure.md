# 0020.1 - Sync Infrastructure

The core synchronization framework that enables seamless data sharing across devices.

## Requirements

### Data Architecture
- Efficient data model for synchronization
- Change tracking mechanism
- Timestamp-based versioning
- Unique identifiers for all syncable entities
- Data partitioning for efficient syncing
- Incremental sync capabilities

### Sync Protocol
- Secure data transmission
- Bandwidth-efficient data transfer
- Compression for large data sets
- Resumable transfers for interrupted connections
- Throttling for server load management
- API versioning for client compatibility

### Conflict Resolution
- Last-write-wins default strategy
- Conflict detection mechanisms
- Merge strategies for compatible changes
- User resolution for incompatible changes
- Conflict history and audit trail
- Rollback capabilities for problematic merges

### Sync State Management
- Sync status tracking per entity
- Progress indicators for ongoing syncs
- Error handling and retry logic
- Sync logs for troubleshooting
- Health checks and diagnostics
- Recovery mechanisms for sync failures

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want my data to automatically sync between devices so I always have access to my latest content
2. As a user, I want to see the sync status so I know when my data is up to date
3. As a user, I want conflicts to be resolved automatically when possible so I don't have to make manual decisions
4. As a user, I want to manually resolve conflicts when necessary so I can choose which version to keep
5. As a user, I want sync to work efficiently over slow connections so I can use the app in areas with poor connectivity
6. As a user, I want to see sync history so I can troubleshoot any issues
