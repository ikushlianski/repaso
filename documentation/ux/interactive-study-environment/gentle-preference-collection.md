# Gentle Preference Collection UX Design

## Overview

A non-intrusive system for collecting user preferences during initial app usage through contextual microinteractions that enhance personalization without disrupting the learning flow.

## Design Principles

### Contextual Timing
- Questions appear during natural workflow pauses
- Triggered by user actions that indicate readiness for input
- Never interrupt active learning or content processing

### Microinteraction Design
- Subtle, dismissible interface elements
- One question at a time to avoid cognitive overload
- Visual design that feels helpful, not demanding

### Progressive Disclosure
- Start with broad, easy-to-answer questions
- Gradually ask more specific questions as user engagement increases
- Respect user choice to skip or defer questions

## Implementation Strategy

### Question Categories

**Learning Style Preferences**
- Content consumption preference (visual vs. text-heavy)
- Difficulty level preference
- Learning pace preference

**Content Preferences**
- Subject area interests
- Content source preferences
- Card generation style preferences

**Workflow Preferences**
- Notification preferences
- Study session length preferences
- Organization and tagging preferences

### Microinteraction Patterns

**Inline Suggestions**
- Small, contextual prompts within existing UI
- Appear after user completes an action
- Can be dismissed with a single click

**Gentle Nudges**
- Subtle highlighting of preference options
- Non-blocking suggestions for personalization
- Visual cues that invite interaction

**Contextual Tooltips**
- Helpful information that includes preference questions
- Educational content that doubles as preference collection
- Non-intrusive overlay elements

## User Experience Flow

### Initial Onboarding (First 3 Sessions)
1. **Session 1**: Basic learning style questions after first content import
2. **Session 2**: Content preference questions after first card generation
3. **Session 3**: Workflow preference questions after first study session

### Ongoing Preference Refinement
- Questions appear during natural workflow transitions
- Frequency decreases as user preferences are established
- Focus shifts to preference refinement rather than initial collection

## Technical Considerations

### Timing Algorithms
- Analyze user behavior patterns to identify optimal question moments
- Avoid asking questions during high-focus activities
- Ensure questions feel natural and helpful

### Data Collection
- Store preferences immediately upon collection
- Apply preferences to subsequent user interactions
- Track question completion rates and user satisfaction

### Fallback Behavior
- Graceful degradation when questions are skipped
- Default preferences based on user behavior patterns
- Option to revisit skipped questions later

## Success Metrics

- Question completion rate (target: >70%)
- User satisfaction with onboarding experience
- Personalization effectiveness in early usage
- Question skip rates and user feedback
- Time to first personalized experience

## Accessibility Considerations

- All microinteractions must be keyboard accessible
- Screen reader compatible question presentation
- Clear visual indicators for dismissible elements
- Consistent interaction patterns across all questions
