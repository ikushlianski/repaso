# Smart Prompting System

## The Strategy

Instead of just showing users a blank input field, we provide intelligent suggestions that guide them toward good learning choices while making them feel in control of the process.

## Topic Suggestions

**Learning Paths**: "Here are the key React topics you should master next"
**Difficulty Progression**: "Ready to move from basics to advanced concepts?"
**Related Topics**: "These topics build on what you've already learned"
**Trending Content**: "Other React developers are learning these topics"
**Gap Analysis**: "You might want to strengthen these areas"

## Prompt Templates

**Structured Prompts**: Pre-written prompts that users can customize
**Topic-Specific**: Different prompts for different subjects (React, medicine, languages)
**Difficulty Levels**: Prompts tailored to beginner, intermediate, or advanced levels
**Learning Goals**: Prompts aligned with specific learning objectives
**Time-Based**: Prompts for quick reviews vs. deep learning sessions

## User Experience Flow

**Discovery**: User sees suggested topics and prompts
**Customization**: User can modify prompts to fit their needs
**Submission**: User submits their customized prompt
**Processing**: We analyze the prompt and route to appropriate model
**Results**: User gets flashcards, often from cache
**Feedback**: User can rate the results and provide feedback

## Caching Strategy

**Similarity Detection**: Detect when prompts are similar to cached content
**Transparent Serving**: Serve cached content while maintaining user agency
**Quality Assurance**: Ensure cached content is still relevant and accurate
**User Notification**: Subtly indicate when content is optimized for them
**Continuous Learning**: Learn from user preferences to improve suggestions
